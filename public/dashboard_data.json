      "fullContent": "Allison Burroughs appears at her 2014 Senate confirmation hearing to be a U.S. district judge. U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee/Screenshot by NPR hide caption\n\nPresident Trump is not happy with U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, who is considering two cases involving Harvard University and the Trump administration.\n\nShortly after Burroughs presided over a July hearing for Harvard's lawsuit over federal funding cuts, the president took to Truth Social and called her a \"Trump-hating Judge,\" adding that she's \"a TOTAL DISASTER.\"\n\nWho is this Massachusetts judge who's drawing so much ire from the White House? NPR spoke with people who know her personally and professionally.\n\n\"She is very self-assured, and she is smart,\" said Lisa Carter, who knows Burroughs through the latter's work with a summer camp for underserved youth.\n\n\"She's enormously self-confident in her skin,\" said retired federal Judge Nancy Gertner, who was on Burroughs' selection committee.\n\n\"What you see is what you get. You know, no BS,\" said Chris Swistro, who worked with Burroughs at Womenade Boston, a now-shuttered nonprofit that funded organizations supporting women and girls.\n\nBurroughs declined to be interviewed for this story. Her clerk said the judge didn't \"think it would be possible or prudent, given the two Harvard cases that are still pending.\"\n\nThe legal experts NPR reached out to were also cautious. Several conservative legal voices, including at the Federalist Society, declined to participate.\n\nBurroughs is 64 years old and has family roots that trace back to Russia. Burroughs' grandfather moved to the U.S. at the turn of the 20th century to escape anti-Jewish violence in the town of Kashoffka, a journey he detailed in a 1930 memoir. He went on to become a lawyer and philanthropist in the Boston area, a path Burroughs herself followed.\n\nThe documents from Burroughs' Senate confirmation show her legal career began nearly 40 years ago. In 1988, she worked as a clerk for U.S. District Judge Norma Shapiro. In 1989, she moved to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, where she prosecuted organized crime cases.\n\nIn 1995, Burroughs returned to Massachusetts to work in the U.S. Attorney's Office there. And in 2005, Burroughs made the leap to criminal defense, spending about 10 years working for the firm Nutter McClennen & Fish in Boston.\n\nBurroughs' nomination to the federal bench came in 2014.\n\nIn an article for the Boston Bar Association, Burroughs recalled her surprise when she got a call from Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts saying she was on a short list of candidates to fill judicial vacancies.\n\n\"Needless to say, I returned the call very promptly,\" wrote Burroughs. \"I have kept that voice mail -- truly one of those calls you don't really ever expect and certainly don't forget.\"\n\nGertner, who was on her selection committee, remembers Burroughs stood out because of her extensive time in the courtroom as both a federal prosecutor and a defense attorney.\n\n\"She knows the system inside and out,\" Gertner told NPR. \"Being a District Court judge is not an abstraction to her.\"\n\nBurroughs herself has described her passion for the bench. During her 2014 confirmation hearing, she told the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that she loves \"everything about the courtroom.\"\n\n\"I love the human drama in there,\" she said. \"Our system of justice is just amazing.\"\n\nBurroughs has witnessed her fair share of drama since joining the federal bench in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, from a major trial involving the Mafia in New England to a lawsuit against Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis after he relocated a group of migrants to Martha's Vineyard. She also issued a temporary restraining order on President Trump's 2017 ban on travel from several Muslim-majority countries.\n\nAnd Burroughs has a lot of experience presiding over cases involving Harvard. One of the most notable was Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard College, in which the plaintiff accused Harvard of discriminating against Asian American and white applicants. Burroughs was the first judge to issue a ruling on the case, and she found that Harvard did not intentionally discriminate against Asian American applicants. Her decision would eventually be overturned by the Supreme Court, effectively ending race-conscious policies in college admissions.\n\nAnother Harvard case made it into her docket in 2020, when the first Trump administration tried to bar international students from the U.S. if their colleges remained online-only during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAnd today, Burroughs is presiding over two significant Harvard cases challenging Trump's attempts to cut federal funding from the university and to ban the school from enrolling international students.\n\nCourt transcripts of pretrial conferences for cases involving Harvard show Burroughs is open about the fact that she wasn't accepted into Harvard's undergraduate program. Occasionally, she'll even joke about it.\n\n\"I don't know if I should be starting to feel better or worse about the fact that I didn't get into Harvard,\" said Burroughs in a 2016 pretrial hearing after it was mentioned that Harvard judges applicants on 1,600 fields of information.\n\nIn fact, she's often lighthearted in court, regularly starting proceedings with language like \"all right, gang.\" During the July hearing for Harvard's federal funding case, Burroughs joked about the fact that several of Harvard's lawyers were present in court while, on the other side, there was just one attorney representing the federal government.\n\n\"It's lonely over there, huh?\" said Burroughs during the hearing.\n\nFormer colleagues say they're familiar with Burroughs' quick wit and sense of humor.\n\nBut they're also quick to point out that Burroughs doesn't mince words when trying to make tough decisions.\n\n\"She can really cut to the chase, and she had the ability to take a lot of perspectives into account and distill them into our strategic plan going forward,\" said Chris Swistro, who used to work with Burroughs on the board of Womenade Boston.\n\nSwistro said Burroughs helped the organization make important financial decisions, and she can see how the same quality would be useful in court.\n\n\"Irrespective of where your heartstrings may be pulled, facts matter, information matters, and we're going to do our best work if we let those drive our decision-making,\" said Swistro, describing Burroughs' philosophy.\n\nThe Trump administration has said it froze Harvard's federal research funding because the university allegedly violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act by failing to address antisemitism on campus.\n\nDuring the July hearing in that case, Burroughs called the federal government's arguments \"mind-boggling.\" She asked the administration's attorney direct questions about what combating antisemitism on campus has to do with funds for cancer research.\n\n\"You're not taking away grants from labs that could have been antisemitic, but just cut off funding in a way one could argue hurts Americans and Jews,\" she said in court.\n\nDuring that hearing, Burroughs also highlighted the fact that she is Jewish and understands the importance of fighting antisemitism.\n\nNPR reached out to some of the federal agencies named in the two Harvard lawsuits. The U.S. Department of Education did not respond to a request for comment about the federal funding lawsuit. In a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security regarding the international student ban case, Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs Tricia McLaughlin said, \"We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.\"\n\nTrump has also said on Truth Social that he expects Burroughs to rule against the federal government but that \"we will IMMEDIATELY appeal, and WIN.\"\n\nMore recently, in late July, Trump said his administration was negotiating a possible settlement with Harvard.\n\nBurroughs' decisions on the two Harvard lawsuits are expected in the next few months.",

      "fullContent": "The Trump administration is seeking a $1 billion settlement from the University of California, Los Angeles, a White House official said Friday, weeks after the Department of Justice accused the school of antisemitism and other civil rights violations.\n\nUCLA is the first public university to be targeted by a widespread funding freeze over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has frozen or paused federal funding over similar allegations against elite private colleges. In recent weeks, the administration has struck deals with Brown University for $50 million and Columbia University for $221 million but has explored larger settlements, such as in its ongoing battle with Harvard University.\n\nThe White House official did not detail any additional demands the administration has made to UCLA or elaborate on the settlement amount. The person was not authorized to speak publicly about the request and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Trump administration had suspended $584 million in federal grants for UCLA, the university said this week. The Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division issued a finding that UCLA violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \"by acting with deliberate indifference in creating a hostile educational environment for Jewish and Israeli students.\"\n\nThe university had drawn widespread criticism for how it handled dispersing an encampment of Israel-Hamas war protesters in 2024. One night, counterprotesters attacked the encampment, throwing traffic cones and firing pepper spray, with fighting that continued for hours, injuring more than a dozen people, before police stepped in. The next day, after hundreds defied orders to leave, more than 200 people were arrested. Later, Jewish students said demonstrators in encampments blocked them from getting to class.\n\nThe University of California's president, James B. Milliken, said Friday the university had \"just received\" a document from the Department of Justice and would review it. He said the size of the proposed settlement would \"devastate\" the University of California, whose campuses are viewed as some of the top public colleges in the nation.\n\n\"Earlier this week, we offered to engage in good faith dialogue with the Department to protect the University and its critical research mission,\" said Milliken, who started as president last week. \"As a public university, we are stewards of taxpayer resources and a payment of this scale would completely devastate our country's greatest public university system as well as inflict great harm on our students and all Californians.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday accused Trump of trying to silence academic freedom in his attack on such a prestigious public university system.\n\n\"He has threatened us through extortion with a billion-dollar fine unless we do his bidding,\" Newsom told reporters. Apparently referencing the settlements with Columbia and Brown, he added: \"We will not be like some of those other institutions that have followed a different path.\"\n\nThe $1 billion demand in the UCLA settlement is linked to Newsom's status as one of Trump's most outspoken foes, said Peter McDonough, vice president and general counsel at the American Council on Education, an association of college presidents.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks this appalling demand is not blatantly political and ideological has their head in the sand,\" McDonough said. \"Of course it's influenced by the fact that UCLA sits within the California system and the California system sits within the state of California.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at elite colleges that the president decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.\n\nLast month, Columbia University agreed to pay $200 million as part of a settlement to resolve investigations into the government's allegations that the school violated federal antidiscrimination laws. The agreement also restored more than $400 million in research grants.\n\nThe Trump administration is using its deal with Columbia as a template for other universities, with financial penalties that are now seen as an expectation. For instance, the administration is pressing for a deal that would require Harvard to pay far more than Columbia's $200 million. Harvard leaders have been negotiating with the White House even as they battle in court to regain access to billions in federal research funding terminated by the Trump administration.\n\nUCLA has already reached one settlement about the 2024 protests. The university agreed last week to pay $6 million to settle a lawsuit from three Jewish students and a Jewish professor who argued the university violated their civil rights by allowing pro-Palestinian protesters to block their access to classes and other areas on campus in 2024.\n\nUCLA initially had argued that it had no legal responsibility over the issue because protesters, not the university, blocked Jewish students' access to areas. The university also worked with law enforcement to thwart attempts to set up new protest camps.\n\nBut in a preliminary injunction a year earlier, U.S. District Judge Mark Scarsi disagreed and ordered UCLA to create a plan to protect Jewish students on campus. The University of California has since created systemwide campus guidelines on protests, with an Office of Campus and Community Safety at UCLA.\n\nAs part of the settlement, UCLA said it will contribute $2.3 million to eight organizations that combat antisemitism and support the university's Jewish community. UCLA Chancellor Julio Frenk, whose Jewish father and grandparents fled Nazi Germany to Mexico and whose wife is the daughter of a Holocaust survivor, also launched an initiative to combat antisemitism and anti-Israeli bias.\n\n___\n\nAP writer Julie Watson contributed to this report.",

      "fullContent": "A divided Supreme Court backed Trump's plan to dismantle the Education Dept. and fire hundreds of federal workers, despite a judge's earlier pause.\n\nATLANTA, Aug 7 (Reuters) - In February, federal worker Stefanie Anderson sat at her kitchen table with her husband and asked questions she never imagined having to face: Were their children safe? Should they pull them from school? Should they leave their home?\n\nA friend had sent her a link to a \"DEI Watchlist\" published by the American Accountability Foundation, a right-wing group with ties to senior officials in U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. It listed Anderson's name, photo, salary and work history, and accused her and other federal employees of pushing \"radical\" diversity, equity and inclusion policies in government.\n\n\"My heart dropped,\" Anderson said.\n\nThe longtime public health worker spent much of her career at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, specializing in infectious disease outbreaks. Her work included a deployment to Sierra Leone during the Ebola crisis. More recently, she supported HIV prevention programs. After her profile appeared on the site, her phone rang for a month with about 30 calls a day from unknown numbers.\n\nAnderson changed her hairstyle to avoid recognition, stayed indoors, rerouted packages from her Atlanta home and reminded her children to lock the doors and check the security cameras. As a Black woman, she said, the experience reminded her of 19th-century fugitive slave ads. \"It made me feel like a criminal on a wanted poster.\"\n\nAnderson is among 175 federal employees, mostly civil servants, named on \"watchlists\" posted online by the American Accountability Foundation, which wants them removed from their jobs for allegedly promoting liberal ideologies. Many are women and people of color with long careers under both Republican and Democratic administrations. Most have little or no public profile and have spent their careers in behind-the-scenes government roles.\n\nReuters spoke with two-dozen people on the lists, all sharing their stories for the first time. Some bolstered home security or avoided going out in public. Others deleted social media accounts or scrubbed personal information from the internet. More than half wrestled with anxiety. Some described a quiet unraveling of their lives, experiencing depression, feeling a need to disappear.\n\nThrough legal filings, public records and interviews with more than three dozen sources, Reuters traced AAF's evolution from a Biden-focused opposition research outfit to a sharp instrument in the Trump movement's campaign to root out perceived enemies.\n\nAAF's target is the federal workforce. Half the people on AAF's watchlists - at least 88 - have left government or been forced onto administrative leave. Some were fired amid Trump's mass federal layoffs. Others departed over fears of termination or reassignment. At least two, worried about their safety, have fled the country.\n\nRather than aiming at high-profile political appointees, AAF's lists focus mostly on career civil servants who execute the policy of the administration in power. AAF President Tom Jones and his backers argue that many of these employees lean liberal and could work quietly to undermine Trump's agenda, so the public deserves to know their identities.\n\n\"They want to be unaccountable bureaucrats who work in these agencies and never get seen,\" he told Fox News in June 2024. \"We're gonna tell you who these people are and what they're about.\"\n\nJones did not respond to a detailed list of questions about AAF or the impact of its watchlists on the civil servants it targets, but defended its work in a statement to Reuters. \"It's important that anti-Trump civil servants know someone is watching and taking names; we stand by our research and reporting, with our only regret being that more people on our lists haven't left government and handed their jobs over to patriots who will execute on the agenda the American people voted for in November.\"\n\nSince October, AAF has published three watchlists. The first, a \"DHS Watchlist,\" named 60 federal employees as \"targets\" for their work on immigration policy at the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice, including nearly a dozen immigration judges. In January, AAF published two more: one identifying \"political ideologues\" at the Education Department, and one featuring staff who worked on diversity initiatives at other federal agencies.\n\nEach site includes photos and personal details drawn from public records and social media, along with allegations of \"subversive,\" \"divisive\" or \"left-wing\" transgressions such as donating to Democrats or supporting immigrant aid groups. Federal employees, however, are allowed to engage in such political activity privately under federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on political affiliation.\n\nBy launching the first list ahead of the 2024 election, the group helped translate Trump's campaign pledge to \"clean out the deep state\" into a database of names and faces. After the DHS list went live, one commenter on AAF's X account posted a photo of bullets. X did not respond to questions about the post.\n\nAs Trump wages a self-described campaign of \"retribution,\" federal workers on AAF's lists have paid a price. In Maryland, a mother at a public library with her toddler was confronted by a woman who said she recognized her from the list. \"What you're doing is disgusting,\" the stranger said. In Texas, a man shattered a window of an immigration judge's home and called her a \"traitor.\" In Georgia, police stationed a patrol car outside a CDC employee's home for a week after she was named for working on initiatives to expand healthcare access in low-income and minority communities.\n\nTo the people targeted by AAF, its sites are engines of reputational harm and invitations to harassment. AAF, however, stops short of crossing an important line, say free-speech experts: It omits home addresses, phone numbers and other intimate identifiers associated with doxxing - the publishing of personal information online with malicious intent. By that standard, the sites remain just outside the boundaries of potential criminal violations of privacy. But legal experts say the watchlists could deter civil servants from politically sensitive work, creating a chilling effect on public service.\n\n\"What is so ominous about these sites is that they're close to the line of illegal, but not crossing the line,\" said University of Virginia School of Law professor Danielle Citron, a specialist in online privacy. \"They are designed to silence and intimidate and to inspire other people to hurt\" people named on the site.\n\nAAF promotes its work as part of a broader effort to defend Trump's \"America First\" platform. On its websites, the group says it exposes \"the truth behind the people and groups undermining American democracy\" and serves as \"a go-to resource for policy makers and their staffs.\" It makes its goal clear to its targets: \"If you see yourself on this list and wish to be removed,\" it says on the watchlists, \"please forward us evidence that you've resigned or been fired.\"\n\nAs AAF singles out federal employees for alleged political bias, the Trump administration has moved to loosen restrictions meant to keep partisanship out of government work. In April, it relaxed enforcement of the Hatch Act, a nearly century-old law designed to insulate the civil service from partisan political pressure. The change allows federal employees to openly support the sitting president while at work, wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats at their desks, for instance.\n\nAAF received $100,000 last year from the conservative Heritage Foundation to support its work, public records show. Much of its early funding and organizational backing came from groups aligned with Trump, including one run by Russell Vought, now Trump's budget director, and another headed by Stephen Miller, a senior Trump advisor. AAF's Jones was an advisor on the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, which calls for slashing the federal workforce and marginalizing \"woke culture warriors.\"\n\nHeritage, Vought, Miller and the White House did not respond to questions, including inquiries about ties between administration officials and AAF or the impact of the watchlists on personnel decisions.\n\nMore than 200,000 federal employees have left government service since Trump took office. The administration says roughly 154,000 accepted buyout offers, while an estimated 55,000 were fired or laid off, according to the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit that tracks federal workforce trends. Reuters could not confirm whether the watchlists influenced staffing decisions. The Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services said they did not. The Education and Homeland Security departments did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n'TERRORIST'\n\nFor those named by AAF, the consequences can be swift.\n\nNoelle Sharp had served as chief federal immigration judge in Houston for three years without incident. Immigration judges are employees of the Justice Department and enjoy civil-service protections. Sharp's life was upended last October when her photograph appeared on AAF's \"DHS Watchlist,\" which claimed to identify \"America's most subversive immigration bureaucrats.\"\n\nAAF targeted Sharp on multiple fronts. Her name was posted alongside details of her career and a pointed accusation: She \"made her bones keeping criminal aliens out of jail and away from deportation.\"\n\nThe group questioned her impartiality, citing her decade-long career as a private immigration attorney and her earlier work with Catholic Charities, a nonprofit that provides legal and humanitarian aid to migrants. The organization, affiliated with the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, has long been a target of the far right for its role in refugee resettlement and assisting migrants. AAF accused the group of facilitating \"mass migration,\" a claim Catholic Charities denies.\n\nAAF also flagged a 2017 social media post in which Sharp, then a private attorney, called Trump an \"embarrassment\" and an \"idiot\" after he criticized NATO allies for leaving the U.S. with a disproportionate share of Europe's defense costs.\n\nSharp said AAF falsely portrayed her as biased. When she applied with the Justice Department to become a judge, she said she underwent extensive vetting that began during Trump's first administration. Her focus, she said, was on clearing immigration backlogs and ensuring cases were handled \"efficiently, effectively and fairly.\"\n\nOn the day the list was published, the right-wing Gateway Pundit website ran a story amplifying the claims and casting Sharp as among a cadre of left-wing bureaucrats accused of betraying America by \"sabotaging border security.\" In the comments section, one reader called for Sharp and others on the list \"to hang for treason.\"\n\nA week later, she said, a stranger appeared at her home, shouting and pounding on the front door until a window shattered. \"Terrorist,\" the man called her. He accused her of letting criminals into the country. \"Someone should do something about you,\" he yelled. Alone at home, Sharp stepped outside and tried to reason with him. \"A lot of what you read on social media isn't true,\" she told him. He kicked her door and left.\n\nSharp said she chose not to report the incident to police, fearing the man might live nearby and retaliate. She informed her supervisors. In late November, she found her car windshield smashed. This time her supervisors alerted the U.S. Marshals Service, which protects federal judges. The Marshals, she said, gave her a phone app to alert authorities in an emergency.\n\nThe Marshals Service declined to comment on Sharp's case or the watchlist. Reuters was unable to determine whether any suspects were identified or what motivated them. In response to an inquiry from Reuters, the Gateway Pundit said it would remove the comment suggesting people on the watchlist should hang for treason.\n\nOn February 14, Sharp was fired. Immigration judges, unlike federal judges with lifetime appointments, serve at the discretion of the attorney general and can be reassigned or dismissed, provided there is cause and due process. Sharp said she believes her inclusion on the watchlist contributed to her dismissal. \"If I hadn't been on the DHS Watchlist, I don't believe I would have lost my job,\" she told Reuters.\n\nSharp requested that AAF remove her photo from its website but said she received no response. Her profile remains on the site. Citing safety concerns because of the watchlist, she recently moved to Mexico with her husband and now works remotely as an immigration attorney.\n\nHer firing coincides with a broader purge. Since Trump took office in January, at least 106 immigration judges have been fired, reassigned or accepted buyouts, according to the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, which represents most of them. Almost all were dismissed without cause, the union said.\n\nThe Justice Department declined to comment on Sharp's firing or the broader purge of immigration judges.\n\nAAF'S BIRTH AND EVOLUTION\n\nAAF was launched in December 2020, weeks after Trump lost his re-election bid to Joe Biden. Its initial mission, as Jones said in a 2021 Fox News interview, was \"to take a big handful of sand and throw it in the gears of the Biden administration.\"\n\nThe group traces its roots to a network of Trump-aligned nonprofits led by the Conservative Partnership Institute, headed by former Senator Jim DeMint and Mark Meadows, who served as chief of staff in Trump's first presidency. CPI provided $335,100, more than half of AAF's first-year funding, according to tax filings.\n\nThe next year, CPI provided another $210,000, and two other CPI affiliates also chipped in. The Center for Renewing America, led by Trump budget chief Vought, and America First Legal, headed by Trump adviser Miller, contributed $100,000 and $25,000, respectively.\n\nVought, a self-described Christian nationalist, and Miller were fixtures in Trump's first White House and have reemerged as architects of his second-term agenda. At its inception, both CPI and America First Legal identified themselves in tax filings as a \"direct controlling entity\" of AAF.\n\nDeMint, CPI, America First Legal and the Center for Renewing America did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nRoughly a decade before AAF launched, Jones, Miller and Vought were congressional staffers aligned with DeMint and other right-wing lawmakers in an insurgency against the Republican establishment. Jones built a reputation for opposition research, said a former DeMint staffer who worked alongside him. \"Jones was one of the harder-edged guys,\" the ex-colleague said.\n\nIn the spring of 2021, AAF launched Bidennoms.com to target Biden administration nominees. The site, no longer active, featured profiles of nominees accompanied by disparaging and at times misleading commentary. In interviews at the time, Jones said he was inspired by the Democrats' success in undermining some of Trump's first-term nominees to top administration posts.\n\nIn June 2022, as Trump prepared to run again, the Heritage Foundation named AAF a partner in Project 2025, a transition plan that called for a dramatic rollback of the federal bureaucracy, including DEI initiatives. Two years later, Heritage awarded AAF $100,000 to launch \"Project Sovereignty 2025,\" a database of federal employees involved in Biden-era immigration policy.\n\nAfter launching his DEI Watchlist in January, Jones told Fox News, \"We're going to help the Trump administration identify the people they need to get out of these positions.\"\n\n\"DANGEROUS\"\n\nAAF's watchlists disproportionately feature women. Although women make up less than half of the federal workforce, they account for more than two-thirds of the 175 federal employees named across the three lists, according to a Reuters analysis. About 50% of those listed are racial and ethnic minorities, compared with 41% of the overall federal workforce.\n\nPatricia Kramer, a 43-year-old U.S. Army veteran and Hispanic employment strategist at the National Institutes of Health in Maryland, said that seeing her name and photograph appear on the list in February triggered the same anxiety she felt during her 2009 deployment to Iraq, when she lived under the constant threat of being targeted by enemy soldiers.\n\n\"You don't know who you're emboldening by posting a list of people that strangers should focus their attention on,\" said Kramer. \"It's dangerous.\"\n\nAfter returning from Iraq, Kramer earned a degree in psychology, motivated by the mental health struggles she and other soldiers faced. A daughter of Mexican immigrants, she later joined the NIH, working to improve Hispanic representation in staffing and research.\n\nThe DEI Watchlist labeled Kramer and 95 others on the site as \"America's Bureaucrats Most Abusing Diversity, Equity and Inclusion.\"\n\nThe watchlist highlighted portions of Kramer's biography that described her collaboration with Hispanic communities, efforts to promote equitable hiring and her work with the Office of Refugee Resettlement during the Biden administration. The group described her record as \"shocking\" and incompatible with Trump's policy goals.\n\nKramer sees her biography as a testament to a public service career spent helping underserved communities. After being spotlighted on the site, she became hypervigilant.\n\nKramer avoided leaving home, scanned her surroundings constantly and monitored her street for anything unusual. Her greatest fear was for her 17-year-old son. \"I was afraid that some unhinged individual would make it his duty to confront those of us on the list,\" she said. And \"potentially hurt one of us or our family members.\"\n\nShe spent months trying to get her photo removed from the site. In February, she filed a takedown request with the site's hosting platform, Webflow, under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which prohibits unauthorized online distribution of copyrighted material.\n\nDocuments related to her takedown request, reviewed by Reuters, show that Webflow initially complied and removed her photo.\n\nIn March, AAF submitted a counter complaint with the host, arguing that the image was an \"official government portrait,\" one of the documents show. AAF also replaced her photo with an illustration of a woman in an office, accompanied by a caption: \"DEI bureaucrats are so ashamed of what they're doing that they don't want to show their faces.\"\n\nKramer contacted Webflow again to prevent her image from being reinstated. By April, a new photo - taken from Kramer's LinkedIn profile - appeared on the site. Kramer has not succeeded in having it taken down.\n\nA Webflow spokesperson declined to comment on the case but said the law allows users to reinstate content if no legal action is taken within 10 to 14 days by the complainant.\n\nTo assist others on the watchlist, Kramer wrote a guide explaining how to file takedown requests. At least eight colleagues initially succeeded in removing their photos, she said. But AAF challenged those removals, arguing -- as it had in Kramer's case -- that the images were \"official government portraits,\" according to the document reviewed by Reuters. AAF succeeded in reinstating their photos.\n\n\"The length at which they're willing to go to intimidate and scare people is just ridiculous,\" Kramer said, who was terminated from her job in July.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the NIH and CDC, did not answer questions about Kramer or others fired after appearing on AAF watchlists. In a statement, the agency said the lists were not considered in personnel decisions, but added, \"DEI has no place at HHS in the Trump Administration.\"\n\n\"We will not apologize for restoring a culture of merit, integrity and neutrality in federal service,\" said spokesperson Andrew Nixon.\n\n\"I FELT LIKE I HAD TO DISAPPEAR\"\n\nShelby Guillen Dominguez, 34, says she felt a wave of fear when she saw her name on the DEI Watchlist in February.\n\nThe site criticized her work as a diversity program specialist at the Department of Health and Human Services. It featured video of a university speech where she discussed expanding opportunities for students from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. The site claimed, without evidence, that her remarks excluded \"certain races.\"\n\n\"I didn't even mention race,\" Dominguez said in an interview. \"It felt like they were framing me as an enemy of the state.\"\n\nAAF shared her information on its X account, which has more than 23,000 followers, accusing her of dropping \"diversity\" from her title \"in a sad attempt to keep her job.\" One commenter called for her to be \"fired and investigated.\" The title change, however, was part of a department-wide reorganization announced a month earlier.\n\nDominguez deleted her social media accounts, locked her credit report and set up alerts to monitor online mentions of her name. She said she stayed indoors, sought therapy, and was prescribed medication for anxiety and depression. She had been at HHS for six months when she was placed on administrative leave in January under Trump's executive order targeting federal DEI programs. In July, she was officially terminated.\n\n\"It was always my dream to work for the federal government,\" she said. \"Now it's all crumbling.\"\n\nKiana Atkins, a longtime federal employee, felt similar stress after landing on the watchlist in January. \"I couldn't sleep,\" said Atkins, 46, who worked at the NIH. \"I was afraid to go out by myself.\"\n\nAtkins joined the agency in 2022 after working for the Census Bureau and the U.S. Navy. Her job focused on reducing employment barriers for Black employees and mentoring students. After being named, she experienced severe anxiety and withdrew from a professional development program. She temporarily disabled her LinkedIn account and tried unsuccessfully to remove her name from AAF's site.\n\nNo longer feeling safe at home alone, she said she made the difficult decision to leave the U.S. and live with family in Central America. She accepted a government buyout and moved in February.\n\n\"I did not feel safe,\" she said. \"I felt like I had to disappear.\"\n\n'DO PEOPLE HATE US?'\n\nSome named on the watchlists are fighting back.\n\nAnderson, the CDC worker who altered her appearance and told her kids to lock the doors, is a member of a complaint filed in March with the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an executive branch agency that adjudicates federal employment disputes. The complaint accuses the Trump administration of violating federal workers' civil and constitutional rights by removing employees alleged to be involved in DEI work. The federal Civil Service Reform Act prohibits personnel decisions based on perceived political affiliation and is meant to protect career staff from the politicization of their work.\n\n\"You can't mistreat government workers because you assume they do not share your politics,\" said Kelly Dermody, one of the attorneys representing the employees.\n\nThe White House has said its directives to eliminate DEI personnel and programs across the federal government were aimed at ending what it describes as unlawful preferences in federal hiring and ensuring neutrality in government activities. The case is pending.\n\nAnderson said the watchlist distorted her work and harmed her reputation without giving her a chance to respond.\n\nAAF claimed that Anderson \"discretely (sic) updated\" her LinkedIn title -- from Advisor on Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility to Public Health Advisor -- to evade a Trump executive order and obscure her \"true duties.\" Anderson said she changed her title after moving into a new role in December. The group also accused her of supporting efforts to muzzle free speech after she liked a LinkedIn post warning about the dangers of health-related misinformation.\n\nDays after her name appeared, Anderson was placed on administrative leave. The Health and Human Services Department declined to comment specifically on her case.\n\nMonths later, Anderson, 50, still avoids crowds, doesn't go out after dark and flinches when the doorbell rings. She choked back tears as she recalled her 13-year-old daughter asking, \"Do people hate us?\"\n\n\"I just can't believe that this is my life in 2025,\" Anderson said.\n\n(Additional reporting: Kristina Cooke, Ted Hesson, David Morgan and Sarah N.

      "fullContent": "LA PAZ, Aug 7 (Reuters) - The rise in power and influence of the Indigenous Aymara in Bolivia has been the country's biggest political shift of recent decades, driven by the success of former President Evo Morales and the leftist party he founded.\n\nBut as Bolivia prepares for a general election on August 17, it seems increasingly clear that Indigenous voters are abandoning the ruling Movement to Socialism, or MAS, the party that once claimed to champion them.\n\nVoters from inner-city Aymara and Quechua communities say their loyalty to MAS has been eroded over the country's worst economic crisis in decades, and younger Bolivians in particular say questions of identity now loom less important.\n\n\"Most Indigenous people are having to deal with how to earn money,\" said Sayuri Loza, an Aymara social media influencer and daughter of Remedios Loza, the first Indigenous woman elected to Bolivia's national legislature.\n\n\"The need for economic stability, for education, for healthcare -- none of those are being met,\" said the 42-year-old, who does not plan to cast her vote for MAS.\n\nBolivia has the highest Indigenous population proportionally of any country in Latin America, at about 62%, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean. Made up of diverse ethnic groups, the largest are Aymara and Quechua, long the backbone of MAS, which has dominated the country's politics for nearly two decades.\n\nNow support for leftist and MAS-affiliated candidates is trailing the right-wing opposition.\n\nA July survey by Ipsos CIESMORI showed Andronico Rodriguez, the leading leftist contender, with just 6% support in July, from 19% earlier this year. Another candidate of Aymara heritage, Eva Copa, stood down from the race last week. Such is the rout that the official MAS candidate is polling around 2%, while Rodriguez has distanced himself from the party.\n\nPresident Luis Arce is not seeking reelection.\n\nNearly half of the electorate is under 35 - a generation that has known no political era other than that shaped by Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous leader, and Arce, his successor.\n\nYounger voters like Lirio Fuertes, 29, who runs a fashion brand and teaches the Quechua language on TikTok, said the party's promises fell short.\n\n\"Indigenous identity was paraded in speeches, flags, and festivals,\" said Fuertes, who on social media goes by T'ikita Wara, meaning little flower in Quechua. \"But it never translated into better healthcare, education, or justice.\"\n\nLoza, a historian who promotes Indigenous traditions on social media, also said public services and financial stability rather than her identity were the key drivers of her vote.\n\nBolivia's emerging middle class, much of it Indigenous, has moved beyond identity politics, and the younger generation spanned diverse professions, said Bolivian sociologist Renzo Abruzzese.\n\n\"Bolivia's social structure has transformed,\" he said.\n\nTENSIONS EMERGE\n\nThe 2006 election of Morales was a historic moment for a nation where Indigenous groups for centuries had felt like second-class citizens. They were forbidden, until the mid-1950s, from entering the square outside the presidential palace. Serfdom was only abolished in 1945.\n\nBefore his first inauguration, Morales received the chieftain's staff at the pre-Inca site of Tiwanaku, pledging to grant rights to the Amerindian majority.\n\n\"Today begins a new era for the native peoples of the world,\" Morales said at the time, surrounded by Indigenous activists who had traveled from as far as the United States.\n\nTensions first emerged with some Indigenous groups in 2011, when Morales  wanted to build a highway through Indigenous territory in the Bolivian Amazon. Protests broke out and relations between MAS and those groups suffered.\n\nMorales, who served three terms until 2019, is barred from running after a failed attempt to change the constitution to allow a fourth term.\n\nHe is now in hiding in the coca-growing region of the Chapare, after a court in December issued a warrant for his arrest on child abuse and terrorism charges. The former president denies the allegations.\n\nInstead of standing for hope, Morales is now associated with disillusionment, Fuertes said.\n\n\"Sadly, Evo Morales and this radicalized group that refuses to relinquish power have caused the Indigenous movement to be associated with anti-democracy, with corruption and abuse,\" she said.\n\nMAS did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The official MAS candidate, Eduardo del Castillo, said last month that the problems in Arce's administration had been \"identified.\"\n\n\"There are people who believe in us and trust us,\" he told EFE in an interview last month.\n\n'WALLET VOTE'\n\nThis election comes as Bolivia faces its worst economic crisis since the mid-1980s. Natural gas exports have plummeted, inflation is at a 40-year high, and dollars are scarce.\n\nThe boliviano currency has lost half of its value on the black market this year, even as the official exchange rate has been held artificially steady by government intervention.\n\nUrban, business-minded Indigenous voters were questioning the relevance of MAS, and many blamed the ruling party's spend-to-grow model for the downturn, said Quechua political analyst, Andres Gomez.\n\n\"The 'wallet vote' is starting to outweigh the identity vote,\" said Gomez.\n\nIt was still unclear, he said, how that would manifest on election day.\n\nPolls show conservative contenders Samuel Doria Medina and Jorge \"Tuto\" Quiroga leading the race, but neither commands more than 30% support, while around a third of Bolivians remain undecided.\n\nIf no candidate wins the August vote outright the election will head to a runoff scheduled for October 19.\n\nSome Indigenous voters who are passing over MAS were also skeptical of the alternatives.\n\n\"The right doesn't understand Indigenous Bolivia either,\" Loza said.\n\nReporting by Monica Machicao in La Paz and Lucinda Elliott in Montevideo.

      "fullContent": "Q2 RESULTS ARE IN -- Over the past few weeks, major health insurers reported their mid-year earnings, and the results have been largely mixed. Some have slashed their yearly guidance amid cost pressures, while others are performing in line with or exceeding their expectations.\n\nBut one common theme prevailed across the insurers' reports in the second quarter: Medical costs continue to be elevated. And looming federal policy changes are leaving insurers -- especially those with large Medicaid and Affordable Care Act businesses -- uncertain about the future of the health insurance marketplaces they operate in.\n\nWhy it matters: Insurers will adjust their pricing for 2026 to address those uncertainties -- which include the expiration of enhanced Obamacare subsidies at the end of the year, unless Congress acts, and provisions in the GOP's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act that cut Medicaid spending and crack down on ACA enrollment verification. That means consumers are sure to see a jump in premiums for next year.\n\nThe latest: On Wednesday, Oscar Health, which mainly offers ACA plans, was the last of the major insurers to report its earnings. The company slashed its yearly guidance a few weeks ago amid elevated Obamacare costs as more people seek out medical care. In the weeks leading up to that, competitors Centene, Elevance Health and Molina Healthcare did the same.\n\nOscar said Wednesday its medical loss ratio -- the percentage it pays out on medical claims compared to administrative costs -- was 91.1 percent in the second quarter, up 12 points compared to the same time last year, largely because the enrollee population is sicker. The market will likely have \"double-digit rate increases next year\" as a result, said Oscar Health CEO Mark Bertolini during an earnings call.\n\nA key takeaway: An uptick in enrollees seeking out medical care has been a common theme across major insurers in Q2.\n\nUnitedHealth Group, the largest insurer and typically an industry bellwether, has struggled with higher-than-expected medical costs this year, particularly as older adults in Medicare Advantage seek care. Executives partly attributed its cost struggle to insufficient Medicare Advantage payment rates finalized by the Biden administration.\n\nThe company also saw elevated cost pressures in its Medicaid and Obamacare businesses, similar to Centene, Molina and Oscar.\n\nBucking the trend: While all the major insurers noted that medical costs continue to be elevated, some were better positioned to weather that trend in the second quarter, likely because of adjustments to plan pricing and benefit cuts they made last year in anticipation of rising costs.\n\nHumana, a large Medicare Advantage insurer, has taken a more conservative approach to benefits in the past few years after it first noticed a rise in costs as older adults sought out care more frequently. The company's medical costs were largely in line with expectations in the second quarter of 2025.\n\nCVS Health's Aetna, which shook up its leadership last year after it struggled to control costs with more members seeking medical care, has seen continual improvements in cost savings throughout 2025, executives said during its earnings call. And Cigna recently reaffirmed its 2025 guidance, as cost trends were elevated but still in line with its expectations.\n\nWELCOME TO THURSDAY PULSE. Bestselling authors James Patterson and Vicky Ward are teaming up to write a book about the December killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO and the hunt for the alleged shooter. Send your tips, scoops and feedback to [email protected] and [email protected], and follow along @kelhoops and @sophie_gardnerj.\n\nDEMS PROBE UNITEDHEALTH -- UnitedHealth Group is coming under the microscope of Democratic senators on the Finance Committee, adding to the mountain of congressional, legal and public scrutiny the health care giant has faced this year.\n\nSenate Finance Committee ranking member Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) are looking into whether the insurance company pads its revenue by encouraging nursing homes to limit the number of hospitalizations of residents enrolled in special needs plans, according to a letter the lawmakers sent today to UnitedHealth Group CEO Stephen Hemsley.\n\nKey context: The inquiry comes after The Guardian reported in May that UnitedHealth has quietly paid nursing homes thousands in bonuses to cut hospital transfers for patients, sometimes risking residents' health. UnitedHealth told The Guardian the allegations are \"verifiably false\" and that the bonus payments to nursing homes help prevent unnecessary and costly hospitalizations.\n\n\"After a briefing with UHG representatives that focused on allegations outlined in recent reporting, we remain concerned about programs UHG is deploying to reduce all-cause hospitalizations and to set advance directives at its contracted nursing homes,\" Wyden and Warren wrote in the letter.\n\nWhy it matters: The scrutiny adds to a tumultuous year for UnitedHealth Group. It comes on the heels of leadership on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee demanding answers from the company earlier this week about how it responded to a recent cyberattack and what steps it will take to prevent another breach.\n\nIn December, the CEO of UnitedHealth's health insurance business was shot and killed in New York, igniting a wave of online vitriol from people sympathetic with the alleged shooter. Bipartisan lawmakers in Congress have signaled interest in cracking down on insurers, including UnitedHealth, amid allegations of excessive care denials.\n\nAnd the Justice Department is investigating its Medicare Advantage business, which has come under scrutiny over its billing practices. Hemsley, who recently took over as CEO after the company's former leader stepped down abruptly in May, acknowledged in June that there could be issues with how the company bills the government.\n\nMeanwhile, rising medical costs have plagued the company this year, sending its stock plunging and leading it to slash its yearly outlook.\n\nWhat's next: Wyden and Warren requested UnitedHealth send a full written response to dozens of questions on hospitalization policies, advance directives, marketing practices and federal oversight no later than Sept. 8.\n\nBUSINESS GROUPS' REJECTION -- A federal judge on Wednesday struck down business advocates' bid to scrap the Biden administration's Medicare drug price negotiation program, ruling the groups lacked standing, POLITICO's Lauren Gardner reports.\n\nA three-judge panel of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with a lower court's decision that the Dayton area and Ohio chambers of commerce are too \"detached\" from the litigation's focus -- the constitutionality of a program affecting drugmakers -- to challenge the law.\n\n\"One could argue, in fact, that the overall standard of living in the Dayton area would actually improve with lower drug prices for its citizenry,\" Circuit Judge Ronald Lee Gilman wrote in the opinion.\n\nBackground: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce led three state and local chambers in Ohio and Michigan in suing the federal government in 2023. They focused their case on AbbVie, the company behind the cancer drug Imbruvica, which was chosen for the first round of price negotiations.\n\nThe groups argued that the Inflation Reduction Act's creation in 2022 of a negotiation process between Medicare and drugmakers violates the First, Fifth and Eighth amendments.\n\nWhat's next: The chambers could ask the 6th Circuit for a so-called en banc rehearing, during which the court's entire bench would reconsider Wednesday's decision, or they could petition the Supreme Court to take the case.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber said in a statement that it's reviewing the decision and \"considering next steps.\"\n\nOD2A UPDATE -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will likely be able to fully fund its Overdose Data to Action program, NPR reports.\n\nA former CDC official, granted anonymity for fear of retribution, and Sharon Gilmartin, executive director of the Safe States Alliance, told Sophie they had confirmed the news with current CDC officials.\n\nPOLITICO reported Tuesday that OD2A grant recipients had faced uncertainty about when they would receive their full obligation.\n\nMAHA MOM PUSH -- Moms Across America, an activist group aligned with the Make America Healthy Again campaign, is urging Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to stand firm on regulating pesticides amid mounting pressure from the agriculture industry to soften his stance, Amanda reports.\n\nIn a letter sent Wednesday to the MAHA Commission, which Kennedy chairs, the group urged that a moratorium be placed on the pesticide glyphosate in the final MAHA report due next week, which will include recommendations to fight chronic disease.\n\n\"Toxic chemicals that pose an unnecessary risk to human health have no place in our food system. ...The EPA can, and should, stop the use of glyphosate in agriculture until there is conclusive evidence that no link exists between this chemical and serious diseases such as cancer,\" said the letter, which was organized by the nonprofit Public Interest Research Group.\n\nWhy it matters: The split between MAHA supporters and the agriculture industry, a key Republican constituency, highlights the tensions facing Kennedy as he vies to turn his MAHA agenda into regulation. The White House assured farm groups earlier this summer that the forthcoming report would include no new policy on pesticides after their draft report in May linked glyphosate to cancer and other health problems.\n\nSophia Wright is now senior adviser for Medicare programs at the Office of Management and Budget. She most recently was chief of the Medicare branch at OMB.\n\nNPR's Rob Stein reports on the revived quest to create gene-edited babies.\n\nSTAT's Veronica Paulus reports on growing state interest in expanding access to restorative reproductive medicine.",

      "fullContent": "\"South Park\" trolled President Donald Trump after Homeland Security used a show screenshot in an ICE recruitment post.\n\nVice President JD Vance doesn't sound too upset about his \"South Park\" debut.\n\nThe vice president reacted on X after being spoofed in the latest episode of the Comedy Central series, which depicted him as a servant of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"Well, I've finally made it,\" Vance wrote on X on Thursday, Aug. 7, in response to a photo of his portrayal on the show.\n\nThe latest \"South Park\" episode, titled \"Got a Nut,\" ends with a sequence set at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort. Both Trump and Vance appear on screen, using photos of them crudely placed on animated bodies. The Vance spoof appeared to be inspired by Hervé Villechaize's sidekick character, Tattoo, from the '70s and '80s ABC series \"Fantasy Island.\"\n\nVance in the episode is physically and verbally abused by Trump, who calls him \"stupid\" and at one point kicks him until he flies off screen. In another scene, he offers to rub baby oil on Trump's lover, Satan.\n\nThe main plot of the episode involves school counselor Mr. Mackey joining Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he is in desperate need of money. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem is mocked throughout and shown repeatedly shooting dogs, a reference to the fact that she once shot and killed an \"untrainable\" dog.\n\nThis was the latest chapter in an ongoing feud between \"South Park\" and the White House, which began with the Season 27 premiere on July 23. The episode, \"Sermon on the 'Mount,\" had Trump get into bed with Satan, and it presented him as a thin-skinned bully who threatens to sue anyone who crosses him.\n\nThat episode concluded with the town of South Park settling a lawsuit from the president by agreeing to do pro-Trump messaging, leading into a public service announcement that shows Trump walking through a desert and removing his clothes until he is completely naked.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Taylor Rogers fired back at the Season 27 premiere in a statement provided to USA TODAY on July 24.\n\n\"The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end -- for years they have come after 'South Park' for what they labeled as 'offense' (sic) content, but suddenly they are praising the show,\" Rogers said. \"Just like the creators of 'South Park,' the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history -- and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak.\"\n\nThe Aug. 6 episode, \"Got a Nut,\" appeared to confirm that Trump and his relationship with Satan will be an ongoing storyline throughout Season 27.",

In an appearance on Fox News' \"Jesse Waters Primetime\" later on Wednesday, Cain said: \"I will be sworn in as an ICE agent ASAP.\"\n\nCain is one of President Donald Trump's most vocal supporters in Hollywood. He publicly endorsed Trump in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections. In an interview with Variety last month, Cain said: \"I love President Trump. I've been friends with him forever... Trump is actually one of the most empathetic, wonderful, generous people you'll ever meet.\"\n\nICE has recently ramped up recruitment efforts as it seeks to carry out Trump's calls for mass deportations. The agency has promoted incentives for recruits, including potential $50,000 signing bonuses and the possibility of up to $60,000 in student loan repayments. The Department of Homeland Security has also removed age limits for new hires.\n\nTrump's administration is attempting to enact a sweeping immigration enforcement agenda. ICE, responding to pressure from the White House to dramatically increase arrests, detained more than 2,200 people in a single day in June -- the most immigrant arrests in the agency's history.\n\nICE agents have drawn intense scrutiny for arresting people who have no known criminal histories and using controversial tactics, including wearing face coverings and detaining people at immigration court hearings.\n\nICE's resources have grown substantially following the passage of \"the Big Beautiful Bill,\" Trump's signature domestic legislation, which provided $14.4 billion in funding for immigrant removals and 10,000 new ICE agents. \"This will help ICE achieve as many as 1 million deportations per year,\" Homeland Security said in a news release.\n\nCain has more than 200 acting credits on the Internet Movie Database. He has appeared in various faith-based films, including the 2014 Christian drama \"God's Not Dead.\"",

The second U.N. SDG aims to achieve \"zero hunger\", which was established in 2015.Click here, opens new tab for more on the U.N.'s goal to end world hunger.\n\nNow, the U.N. says more than 1,000 people have been killed trying to receive aid in the enclave since the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation began operating in May 2025, most of them shot by Israeli forces operating near GHF sites.\n\nAt least 40 Palestinians were killed by Israeli gunfire and airstrikes on Gaza on Monday, including 10 seeking aid, health authorities said, adding another five had died of starvation in what humanitarian agencies say may be an unfolding famine.\n\nThe 10 died in two separate incidents near aid sites belonging to the GHF, in central and southern Gaza, local medics said.\n\nIn Sudan, hundreds of thousands of people under siege in the Sudanese army's last holdout in the western Darfur region are running out of food and coming under constant artillery and drone barrages, while those who flee risk cholera and violent attacks.\n\nAl-Fashir, the capital of North Darfur state, is the biggest remaining frontline in the region between Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), under fire at a pivotal point in a civil war now well into its third year.\n\nWhat's being done about Gaza's hunger crisis?\n\nThis week, Israel said it will allow gradual and controlled entry of goods to Gaza through local merchants, according to an Israeli military agency that coordinates aid, as images of starving Palestinians, including children, have alarmed the world in recent weeks.\n\nIsrael's COGAT said a mechanism has been approved by the cabinet to expand the scope of humanitarian aid, allowing the entry of supplies to Gaza through the private sector.\n\n\"This aims to increase the volume of aid entering the Gaza Strip, while reducing reliance on aid collection by the U.N. and international organisations,\" it added.\n\nIt was unclear how this aid operation would work given the widespread destruction in Gaza.\n\nPalestinian and U.N. officials say Gaza needs around 600 aid trucks to enter per day to meet the humanitarian requirements - the number Israel used to allow into Gaza before the war.\n\nThe announcement on the aid comes as Israel's cabinet is considering a complete military takeover of Gaza for the first time in two decades, media reported, despite international pressure for a ceasefire to ease appalling conditions in the besieged Palestinian territory.\n\nWhat's happening in Sudan?\n\nThe war between the Sudanese army and the RSF erupted in April 2023 when the former allies clashed over plans to integrate their forces.\n\nThe RSF made quick gains in central Sudan, including the capital Khartoum, but the army pushed them westward this year, leading to an intensification in fighting in al-Fashir.\n\nHundreds of thousands of al-Fashir's residents and people displaced by previous attacks are living in camps that monitors say are already facing famine.\n\nThis week, the UN refugee agency UNHCR said that emergency funding to help hundreds of thousands of refugees in Uganda will run out next month unless more support comes in as a funding crisis is threatening programmes for people fleeing Sudan, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nOne doctor, who asked not to be named for her safety, said hunger was an even bigger problem than the shelling.\n\n\"The children are malnourished, the adults are malnourished. Even I, today, haven't had any breakfast because I can't find anything,\" she said.\n\nThe RSF has blocked food supplies and aid convoys trying to reach the city have been attacked, locals said. Prices for the goods traders are able to smuggle in cost more than five times the national average.\n\nMany people have resorted to eating hay or ambaz, a type of animal feed made out of peanut shells, residents told Reuters. One advocacy group said even ambaz was running out.\n\nESG SPOTLIGHT\n\nWhat happens to the pets of the people detained or deported by the rise of Los Angeles immigration raids under the Trump administration? That's what today's spotlight story seeks to answer.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control has been taking care of dogs and cats after their owners were detained or deported. From June 10, the county has taken in 28 animals, 22 of whom are dogs. Eleven dogs and two cats have been placed with homes since then.\n\n\"The animals have become sort of a victim in this situation because, to no fault of their own, they're finding themselves in the care centers,\" said Christopher Valles, public information officer for the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control.\n\nToday's Sustainable Switch was edited by Jane Merriman\n\nThink your friend or colleague should know about us?

      "fullContent": "Aug 7 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits ticked up to the highest level in a month last week, suggesting the labor market was largely stable even though job creation is weakening and it is taking laid-off workers longer to find new employment.\n\nInitial claims for state unemployment benefits for the week ended August 2 rose 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 226,000, the highest level since the week ending July 5, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 221,000 claims for the latest week.\n\nThe labor market has slowed, with government data last week showing far fewer jobs were created in July than economists had expected as uncertainty over President Donald Trump's tariffs left businesses wary of adding workers. Moreover, employment gains in the previous two months were revised lower by nearly 260,000, a stunning reversal that prompted Trump to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics - a move that rattled investors and economists already anxious about the eroding quality of official U.S. economic data.\n\nThe latest data on new claims indicates employers are not yet turning to large-scale layoffs as the economy loses steam but are managing through attrition. That has helped keep the unemployment rate, at 4.2% in July, relatively low even while job growth has slowed. Declining labor supply amid the White House's immigration crackdown is also helping to stave off a jump in the jobless rate.\n\nEmployers' hesitancy to increase hiring means there are fewer jobs for those being laid off. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, rose to a seasonally adjusted 1.974 million during the week ending July 26, the claims report showed. That was the highest level of so-called continued claims since November 2021, and the increase of 38,000 from the previous week was the largest since late May.\n\nDespite the rise in both new and ongoing claims last week, economists note the two continue to remain largely range-bound and have not exhibited the kind of breakout upswing that in the past has signaled a deteriorating job market. Indeed, the weekly net change in new claims has remained below 10,000 - in either direction - for 10 straight weeks, the longest such streak in about three years.\n\n\"The sideways drift in initial and continuing claims in recent months suggests that layoff activity is muted,\" Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, wrote in a note. \"The 'no hire/no fire' theme in the labor market remains firmly intact.\"\n\nThat said, continued claims had been averaging less than 1.9 million until early May and in the three months since have averaged about 40,000 higher at about 1.94 million. That reset now makes more sense to some economists in light of the historic downward revision to the job creation figures for May and June that were revealed by BLS last week.\n\n\"The level of continued claims is still signaling that unemployed workers are finding it tough to find a job in a labor market where hiring is slow,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote. \"Moreover, the steep rise in claims since April makes more sense following the sharp downward revisions to job growth in May and June and the sluggish pace of hiring in July.\"\n\nPRODUCTIVITY REBOUNDS\n\nMeanwhile, the Labor Department also said worker productivity rebounded more than expected in the second quarter, easing a surge in labor costs at the start of the year.\n\nNonfarm business sector productivity increased 2.4% in the April-June period after declining by 1.8% in the first three months of the year, BLS reported. Economists polled by Reuters had expected productivity to rise by 2.0%.\n\nWorker output increased by 3.7%, the largest improvement since the third quarter of 2023, while unit labor cost growth moderated to 1.6% from an upwardly revised 6.9% in the first quarter. The data may be indicative of ongoing investments by businesses in labor-saving technologies like artificial intelligence, economists said.\n\n\"Productivity growth is settling back into its historical trend after bouncing around because of the pandemic,\" said Oren Klachkin, financial market economist at Nationwide. \"Looking ahead, businesses will likely invest in labor-saving technologies to cap their wage bills, which should exert downward pressure on inflation. Companies facing the greatest labor constraints will likely be the most incentivized to invest.\"\n\nReporting by Dan Burns; Editing by Paul Simao\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tab",

Apple is also set to expand its factories in the U.S.\n\nWith trembling hands, Cook opened an Apple box he said was made in California, took out a circular plaque with an Apple-shaped cutout in the middle made of glass apparently made in Kentucky, and attributed the design to a former U.S. Marine Corps corporal who now works at Apple. The plaque was set in a 24-karat gold base Cook said was made in Utah.\n\nPart of Trump's longstanding \"America First\" approach to policy is pushing to have more goods made in America. Though Trump has also been gifted a Tesla Cybertruck with a picture of himself on it and a framed copy of his grandfather's German birth certificate, Cook's gift appealed to more than just Trump's preference to have things made in America.\n\nTrump adorns his space and the things he makes in gold.\n\nGold tweezers, gold sneakers and a gold guy in the White House\n\nTrump's affinity for gold predates his time in the Oval Office. Here is a look at some of his golden adornments throughout the years:\n\n* In 2006, Trump met porn star Stormy Daniels at a golf tournament in Lake Tahoe, as she testified during his hush money trial. She said that she saw a set of apparently golden manicure items like tweezers in his hotel suite. (Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records at that trial.)\n\n* As a presidential hopeful, he updated his private plane in 2011 to a Boeing 757 and outfitted it with gold-leafed seatbelts and faucets, according to the New York Post.\n\n* Trump Mobile was announced on the 10-year anniversary of Trump declaring his candidacy in 2015, when he famously rode down the golden escalator in Trump Tower.\n\n* During his campaign for a second term, Trump sold gold sneakers for $399 and a limited edition gold watch for $100,000.\n\n* The Trump Organization sells several gold tchotchkes under the \"Golden Age of America\" collection, including chocolate bars, ornaments, coin banks and playing cards that are fashioned like gold bars with Trump's name on them.\n\n* Trump has brought in his \"gold guy\" from South Florida to adorn the Oval Office in the style of his Mar-A-Lago estate, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n* Amid widespread immigration crackdowns and the return of a controversial travel ban, Trump announced a \"gold card\" visa that offers applicants residency and a path to U.S. citizenship for $5 million paid to the U.S. government.\n\nApple touts additional $100 billion in U.S. investment\n\nCook was one of several tech leaders who attended Trump's inauguration earlier this year.\n\nApple had said in February that it would spend $500 billion in U.S. investments over four years, but the Washington Post reported most of that would cover the regular cost of doing business. The White House announcement brings the total investment figure up to $600 billion.\n\nStill, Apple broke ground on a Houston factory to make advanced AI servers earlier this year, and Trump said on Aug. 6 it would invest billions to construct data centers across the country, including in North Carolina, Iowa and Oregon.\n\n\"I'm proud to say that Apple is leading the creation of an end-to-end silicon supply chain right here in America,\" Cook said.\n\nTrump said the planned 100% tariff on semiconductors and computer chips would not apply to companies that make a commitment to manufacture in the U.S., like Apple.\n\nContributing: Joey Garrison, Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy, Aysha Bagchi, Lauren Villagran, Marina Pitofsky, Jonathan Limehouse, USA TODAY\n\nKinsey Crowley is the Trump Connect reporter for the USA TODAY Network.

      "fullContent": "Domingo Mendoza Méndez with his wife Rafaela Flores, in Minnesota, in 2024. Rafaela Flores\n\nDomingo Mendoza Méndez's eyes fill with tears as he says he hasn't seen his family since July 10, when he went to an appointment with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and was detained.\n\n\"I'm in the process for a U visa and they detained me, but I don't know why they're detaining me. I'm following all their rules,\" Mendoza Méndez, a 45-year-old Mexican immigrant, said in a video call with Noticias Telemundo from the Freeborn County Correctional Facility in Minnesota.\n\nIn 2013, Mendoza Méndez, who had crossed the border 13 years earlier, was the victim of a violent robbery in Minnesota, which was recorded and investigated by police. The type of assault he suffered is included in the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) list of crimes that qualify for a U visa, a measure designed for victims of criminal acts in the U.S. who agree to help authorities investigate the crime.\n\nHowever, as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign, some immigrants who've applied and are in the process of waiting for a U visa have been detained.\n\n\"I feel sad. I'm trying to gather my strength, but there are so many things happening here. Many of us are having our rights violated,\" said the married father of three children, adding that he's been in the process of obtaining a visa since 2021.\n\nMagdalena Metelska, the immigration attorney handling Mendoza Méndez's case, said that other administrations didn't take coercive measures against victims applying for U visas, but that has changed with the second Trump administration.\n\nNow, if someone has a visa pending and even been given a work permit notification, like Mendoza Méndez, \"it doesn't really matter because these people are also being arrested and detained,\" she said.\n\nIn April, Jose Madrid-Leiva, a Guatemalan immigrant who was waiting for a U visa, was detained in Kansas City. That same month, Guatemalan immigrant Gerber Mazariegos Dávila, who was applying for a U visa, was detained by ICE agents in Atlanta. In June, Esvin Juárez and Rosmeri Miranda-López, a Guatemalan couple with four children whose U visa application had been approved were deported to their homeland.\n\nThe U visa was created by Congress in 2000 through the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act (TVPA) and is reserved for victims of certain crimes who \"have suffered physical or mental harm\" and who cooperate with law enforcement or government officials \"in the investigation or prosecution of criminal activity,\" according to USCIS.\n\n\"The U visa is a humanitarian benefit, but it's also a law enforcement tool,\" explained Hannah Shapiro, supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society, which provides legal help to low-income families and individuals. \"It requires the individual to cooperate in an investigation or prosecution related to the visa-qualifying offenses, which can be recent or have occurred several years ago.\"\n\nShe added the visa was designed to make communities safer by incentivizing undocumented survivors of domestic abuse and other crimes to contact police and cooperate in investigations, thus helping make abusers accountable.\n\nThe U visa's benefits include the ability to live and work in the U.S. and a chance to apply for a green card in the future. However, as with other visas for victims of abuse and crime, such as the Special Immigrant Juvenile program, the U.S. government only grants 10,000 U visas per year, which has created a considerable backlog for applicants.\n\nThere are more than 300,000 people waiting, in addition to qualifying family members, Shapiro explained, and the process can take up to 15 or 20 years.\n\nAccording to USCIS numbers, the government received 266,293 primary U visa applications from fiscal year 2017 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n\n\"This means that if all U visa applications were halted today, it would take more than 20 years to resolve the pending cases. Since fiscal year 2009, USCIS has seen a 2013% increase in pending cases,\" USCIS said in a statement sent to Noticias Telemundo.\n\nSince June 2021, USCIS has been granting \"good faith determinations\" -- official documents that validate the legitimacy of the U visa application and protects applicants from deportation while giving them work authorization.\n\nImmigration experts and attorneys say the Trump administration is now asserting that \"good faith determinations\" do not protect people from deportation, leading to detentions of U visa applicants.\n\n\"I always carried in my wallet the letter of good faith that ICE had approved for me, which states that I have the right to be in the United States without fear of deportation. But the agents told me they were no longer respecting that. And they took me away,\" said Mendoza Méndez.\n\nMatthew J. Tragesser, chief of USCIS' Office of Public Affairs, said in a statement to Noticias Telemundo that \"a good faith determination on a pending application for U nonimmigrant status does not protect a foreign national from immigration enforcement.\"\n\nTragesser also stated that \"the U visa program is being exploited by foreign scammers and criminals, their corrupt lawyers, and law enforcement officers,\" though he did not provide specific figures or cases.\n\nLast month, USCIS announced that five Louisiana men, including four active and retired law enforcement officers, had been charged with bribery, conspiracy to commit visa fraud and mail fraud following a federal investigation that uncovered a pattern of inconsistencies in U visa applications. According to the agency, the defendants filed false police reports so that foreign nationals who were supposedly victims of the thefts could apply for U visas.\n\nAlthough the fundamental structure of the U visa program remains intact (since it was created by Congress, it can't be unilaterally eliminated), several experts and applicants say its practical implementation has become significantly harder.\n\n\"Shortly after Trump returned to power, they repealed a memorandum that considered victim status a discretionary factor that, except in extenuating or more serious circumstances, should not be a priority for removal. This is even true if their case was pending and had not been approved,\" Shapiro said.\n\nThe attorney refers to Memorandum 11005.4 , which changed the agency's approach to immigration enforcement related to U visa applicants. Among other things, this new directive eliminates proactive victim identification, so ICE officers are no longer required to look for clues or evidence suggesting a foreign national is a victim of a crime when making enforcement decisions.\n\n\"With the new Department of Homeland Security rules, these cases are being reopened. So people who were helping the police, who had suffered some type of crime, or were victims of a very serious crime are now in deportation proceedings,\" immigration attorney Benjamín Osorio said.\n\nOne such case is that of Fredy Hernández Cedillos, a Salvadoran immigrant who has lived in the U.S. since 2009. He was injured during a violent robbery in Virginia in 2010 and has been waiting for a U visa since 2020.\n\n\"My lawyer received a letter from DHS saying they're going to reopen our case, even though we've already gone to court. So our fear is that we can't return to our country because gangs are after us. And we don't know if we'll have to leave our children,\" said Cedillos.\n\nU.S. law allows migrants applying for this visa to continue the visa process in the countries to which they were deported. However, lawyers like Osorio warn of the difficulties involved in this process.\n\n\"Yes, they can continue their procedures. But the problem is that if the waiting list is more than 10 years long, people have to spend that time in the country to which they were deported, and they are often in danger there. Furthermore, if they have American children, they will suffer without their parents, because deportation affects the entire family,\" Osorio said.\n\nThe prosecution of these cases made headlines in January, when a Michigan court ruled that a group of crime survivors applying for U visas could move forward with a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for unjustifiable delays in receiving initial good faith determinations, which, among other things, has prevented them from accessing work permits.\n\n\"We have several clients who have waited nearly six years without any updates or news, not even an initial acknowledgment of the legitimacy of their case. The court ruled that our clients have been harmed by these delays,\" Meredith Luneack, the plaintiffs' attorney, said in a statement. This case is still being reviewed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.\n\nThe Trump administration has demanded a drastic increase in the immigrant detentions and deportations, with a daily quota of 3,000 arrests. Shapiro, along with other experts, says this pressure has resulted in hundreds of people being detained while attending their immigration court appearances.\n\n\"You want to do things right and work in this country, but what I see is that the government wants to remove as many people as possible. The fear is going to court and, once we're there, they won't let us out,\" Cedillos said.\n\nMendoza Méndez remains detained as he battles in court to stay in the U.S. With a broken voice, he said he hasn't lost hope of returning to his family in Minnesota. \"I still have faith and I know we'll be able to get through all of this,\" he said.",

      "fullContent": "MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge on Thursday ordered a temporary halt to construction at an immigration detention center -- built in the middle of the Florida Everglades and dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz\" -- as attorneys argue whether it violates environmental laws.\n\nThe facility can continue to operate and hold detainees for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but workers will be barred from adding any new filling, paving or infrastructure for the next 14 days. U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams issued the ruling during a hearing and said she will issue a written order later Thursday.\n\nEnvironmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe have asked Williams to issue a preliminary injunction to halt operations and further construction. The suit claims the project threatens environmentally sensitive wetlands that are home to protected plants and animals and would reverse billions of dollars' worth of environmental restoration.\n\nPlaintiffs presented witnesses Wednesday and Thursday in support of the injunction, while attorneys for the state and federal government were scheduled to present next week.\n\nFollowing Thursday's testimony, Paul Schwiep, an attorney for the environmental groups, asked Williams to issue a temporary restraining order that would at least prevent any new construction at the site while the preliminary injunction was argued.\n\nWilliams asked Florida attorney Jesse Panuccio if the state would agree to halt construction so that she wouldn't need to issue the restraining order. She pointed out that anything built at the site would likely remain there permanently, regardless of how the case was ultimately decided.\n\nPanuccio said he couldn't guarantee that the state would stop all work.\n\nThis sparked an hour-long hearing about the temporary restraining order, which will be in place for the next two weeks while the still ongoing preliminary injunction hearing continues.\n\nThe crux of the plaintiffs' argument is that the detention facility violates the National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to assess the environmental effects of major construction projects.\n\nPanuccio said during the hearing that although the detention center would be holding federal detainees, the construction and operation of the facility is entirely under the state of Florida, meaning the NEPA review wouldn't apply.\n\nSchwiep said the purpose of the facility is for immigration enforcement, which is exclusively a federal function. He said the facility wouldn't exist if it wasn't for the federal government's desire for a facility to hold detainees.\n\nWilliams said Thursday that the detention facility was at a minimum a joint partnership between the state and federal government.\n\nThe lawsuit in Miami against federal and state authorities is one of two legal challenges to the South Florida detention center which was built more than a month ago by the state of Florida on an isolated airstrip owned by Miami-Dade County.\n\nA second lawsuit brought by civil rights groups says detainees' constitutional rights are being violated since they are barred from meeting lawyers, are being held without any charges, and a federal immigration court has canceled bond hearings. A hearing in that case is scheduled for Aug. 18.\n\nUnder the 55-year-old federal environmental law, federal agencies should have examined how the detention center's construction would impact the environment, identified ways to minimize the impact and followed other procedural rules such as allowing public comment, according to the environmental groups and the tribe.\n\nIt makes no difference that the detention center holding hundreds of detainees was built by the state of Florida since federal agencies have authority over immigration, the suit said.\n\nAttorneys for federal and state agencies last week asked Williams to dismiss or transfer the injunction request, saying the lawsuit was filed in the wrong jurisdiction. Even though the property is owned by Miami-Dade County, Florida's southern district is the wrong venue for the lawsuit since the detention center is located in neighboring Collier County, which is in the state's middle district, they said.\n\nWilliams had yet to rule on that argument.\n\nThe lawsuits were being heard as Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis ' administration apparently was preparing to build a second immigration detention center at a Florida National Guard training center in north Florida. At least one contract has been awarded for what's labeled in state records as the \"North Detention Facility.\"",

Williams made the decision on Thursday after two days of testimony in Miami federal court.\n\nThe hearing comes after environmental groups sued in June to stop the facility, which opened in July on an airstrip located in the sensitive wetlands of Ochopee's Big Cypress National Preserve, from operating.\n\nThe suit claimed the center was built without mandatory ecological reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act, without public notice or comment, and the government failed to comply with other state and federal statutes, including the Endangered Species Act.\n\nThe construction of the site -- which came as part of the Trump administration's cracking down on immigration -- was hotly protested by environmental groups and Native Americans, as the Everglades is a unique, marshy habitat home to endangered and threatened species.\n\nChristopher McVoy, an Everglades expert, environmental scientist, and board member of Friends of the Everglades -- an Everglades preservation nonprofit and one of the parties who filed the suit, testified Thursday.\n\nHe said he visited the detention center site on June 28, when an incident commander showed him around and told him they were paving some areas. McVoy described photos of the area since construction on the facility began and said, \"You're looking at 11 acres of new pavement.\" He also described an increase in traffic in the area.\n\nDillon Reio, a professional geologist in Florida who works for SCS engineers providing assessments of development projects, said his assessment of the \"Alligator Alcatraz\" plans showed it lacked \"a cohesive storm water plan for the site,\" while warning that runoff can create contaminants, and \"there could be offsite impacts.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Eve Samples, the executive director of Friends of the Everglades, testified that more than 40,000 people made submissions on its website to oppose the detention center.\n\nSamples testified that the group is concerned about the potential impacts of run-off, the industrial-style lights that are visible from 15 miles away despite a dark sky designation, and increased traffic.\n\n\"Driving out there myself many times, the increased traffic is visible. I saw two dead gators last time I visited, so definitely a difference in the area,\" she told the court.\n\nJessica Namath, daughter of former NFL star Joe Namath -- who was in attendance -- also testified Wednesday. Namath, also a member of Friends of the Everglades, said that the detention facility has created light pollution and that the area looks \"heartbreakingly different.\"\n\n\"Alligator Alcatraz\" has faced other legal action for alleged inhumane conditions and treatment of detainees.\n\nThe conditions were described as horrific by legal advocates and relatives of immigrant detainees, including cage-like units, mosquito infestations, and unsanitary conditions. NBC Miami has also reported on detainees' and family members' allegations of \"inhumane conditions\": limited access to showers, spoiled food, and extreme heat.\n\nCivil rights lawyers last month sought a temporary restraining order against the facility, claiming constitutional rights violations, alleging detainees have been prevented from meeting attorneys and are being held without charges.",

      "fullContent": "Ichiro Suzuki of the Seattle Mariners in Peoria, Ariz., in 2007.Stephen Dunn / Getty Images file\n\nFor baseball fans across the country, outfielder Ichiro Suzuki's induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame this weekend is the capstone to a storied career of broken records. But for players of Asian descent, it's also a profound moment of recognition and visibility.\n\nSuzuki, who spent the majority of his 19 years in Major League Baseball with the Seattle Mariners, will be the first Asian player to be added to the historic hall in Cooperstown, New York. Asian and Asian Americans across the league spoke to NBC News, reflecting on their favorite Suzuki moments and how his performance on the field helped usher in a generation of players who sought to follow in his footsteps.\n\n\"He was a player who looked like me: Left-handed, played the outfield,\" said Cleveland Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan, who's of Japanese and Chinese descent. \"It kind of gave me hope at a really young age to see that someone who looks like me, plays like me, is able to succeed at the highest level and, not only that, gain the respect of everybody in the league too.\"\n\nSuzuki joins starting pitcher CC Sabathia and relief pitcher Billy Wagner as part of the class of 2025 to be inducted on Sunday. Other inductees include the late right fielder Dave Parker and first baseman Dick Allen, who died in 2020.\n\nSuzuki, who missed a unanimous selection by a single vote, began his U.S. career in 2001 as the first Japanese position player to join MLB. While he wasn't the first ever player from Japan to join the big leagues -- pitcher Masanori Murakami played a short stint with the San Francisco Giants in 1964, and Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Hideo Nomo had a 13-year career in the States -- Suzuki was by far the most successful.\n\nIn his almost two decades in the league, Suzuki made a name for himself as an elite contact hitter and a defensive genius who was also known to ham it up for those who played with him and serve impeccable style. His career includes 10 All-Star selections, 10 Gold Glove awards and three Silver Slugger awards. His time in MLB contributed to more Japanese players exploring careers in the U.S.\n\nKwan, a two-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glove winner in his own right, said growing up, it was critical for him to see a player who never hid his Japanese heritage, always embraced his background and took the field as simply himself. Suzuki's baseball IQ also made a lasting impression on the Guardians outfielder. When Suzuki was on the Miami Marlins in 2015, he faked out Joaquin Arias of the San Francisco Giants, keeping Arias from scoring on a double to the right-field wall.\n\n\"He was near the end of his career. ... And even in his older age, he still had the baseball IQ to make it look like he was going to catch the ball, field the ball off the wall cleanly,\" Kwan said. \"I just remember that at the end of his career he was still making an impact. That was special to me.\"\n\nArizona Diamondbacks outfielder Corbin Carroll said that as an Asian American who grew up in Seattle and frequently attended Mariners games, he was similarly in awe of Suzuki. Carroll, who's of Taiwanese descent, said he still remembers sitting in the right-field bleachers with his family as his mother snapped a photo of Suzuki striking his signature pose.\n\n\"That's one of my earliest memories. The photo I kept in my room as I was growing up and still have to this day,\" Carroll said.\n\nCarroll, who in 2023 became the first Asian American MLB Rookie of the Year, said that all those years watching the Japanese trailblazer \"made me feel like maybe one day I could do it and play at that level,\" he said.\n\n\"When kids grow up seeing someone who they can relate to in some way, it can inspire them and give them hope to do something big,\" Carroll, a two-time All-Star, said.\n\nSuzuki previously told NBC News that he didn't set out to \"perform for Asians\" but was more than aware that his performance would impact the group in addition to his home country of Japan. And he had to excel.\n\n\"As a player from Japan, as a guy that had led the league in hitting all seven years, and then coming over being a first position player, I knew that I would be judged. And Japan baseball will be judged on how I did,\" Suzuki said. \"If I wasn't able to produce, then they would judge Japan baseball as being at a lower level. And so that pressure was there and that's what I had to carry.\"\n\nBryan Woo, an All-Star pitcher for the Mariners, admitted that as a player of Chinese descent from Oakland, California, he may not have been the biggest Seattle fan growing up, but he was a fan of Suzuki's. Woo said he was particularly struck by Suzuki's performance in the 2007 All-Star Game in San Francisco, during which he hit an inside-the-park home run. Suzuki, who was crowned MVP of that game, went 3-for-3 that night. And his dinger remains the only inside-the-park home run ever hit during an All-Star game.\n\nWoo said that these days, Suzuki, who still works for the Mariners as a special assistant to the chairman, continues to dispense his wisdom, ensuring that progress doesn't stop with his own playing career.\n\n\"Guys that have his career and his caliber don't have to do stuff like that, but people that do that go out of their way. That means a lot.\" Woo said.\n\nUltimately, Kwan said, Suzuki's place in the Hall of Fame is symbolic of a new era.\n\n\"I think it's just showing that one person needs to pave the way for a whole generation to believe that they can play baseball,\" Kwan said.",

Earlier this week, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Education Department sent a joint letter alleging racial preferences in Duke's hiring and admissions.\n\nDuke is the latest institution to have its federal funding held up as the government investigates allegations of antisemitism and diversity, equity and inclusion policies the administration says are unlawful. It follows other probes including at Harvard, Columbia, and Cornell.\n\nDuke did not immediately comment.\n\nIn Monday's letter to Duke, leaders of HHS and the Education Department accused the university of \"vile racism.\" It alludes to allegations of racial preferences at Duke, its medical school and its health system that, if substantiated, would make Duke \"unfit for any further financial relationship with the federal government.\"\n\nThe letter accuses Duke of providing racial preferences in recruiting, admissions, scholarships, hiring and more. It refers to allegations of discrimination without offering specific examples.\n\n\"Racism is a scourge when practiced by individuals, but it is especially corrosive when enshrined in the nation's most eminent and respected institutions,\" according to the letter, signed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Education Secretary Linda McMahon.\n\nIt's part of a broader campaign to eradicate DEI practices the Trump administration describes as discrimination against white and Asian American people.\n\nIn their letter, the agencies order Duke to end any practices at its health system that give \"benefits or advantages\" based on race.\n\nSaying Duke is unlikely to be capable of an \"honest and trustworthy review,\" the letter takes the unusual step of requesting a new Merit and Civil Rights Committee that would be approved by the government and authorized by the school's board of trustees. The panel would be tasked with identifying and ending any racial preferences. If problems remained after six months, the administration would pursue legal enforcement, the letter said.\n\nThe Education Department separately opened an investigation into the Duke Law Journal on Monday over allegations that it gave advantages to prospective editors from underrepresented groups.\n\nThe Trump administration has used federal research funding as leverage in its effort to reshape universities that President Donald Trump has described as hotbeds of liberalism. It has presented a crisis for universities that rely on federal grants as a major source of revenue, spurring some to take on debt and find other ways to self-fund research.\n\nDuke University spent $1.5 billion on research last year, with nearly 60% coming from federal sources, according to the university's website.\n\nEven before the latest funding freeze, Duke faced financial turmoil. Last week, university leaders said almost 600 employees had accepted voluntary buyouts but that layoffs would still be needed. Officials said they needed to reduce costs amid uncertainty around federal research funding and a hike to the university's federal endowment tax.\n\nThe Trump administration has been ratcheting up pressure on universities in hopes of striking deals like one that Columbia University signed last week. The Ivy League school agreed to pay $200 million and make changes to admissions, hiring, student discipline and more in exchange for regaining access to federal funding. The administration has described it as a template for other universities including Harvard, which has been in talks with the administration even as it battles the White House in court.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press' education coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

      "fullContent": "WASHINGTON -- Brown University will pay $50 million to Rhode Island workforce development organizations in a deal with the Trump administration that restores lost federal research funding and ends investigations into alleged discrimination, officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe university also agreed to several concessions in line with President Donald Trump's political agenda. Brown will adopt the government's definition of \"male\" and \"female,\" for example, and must remove any consideration of race from the admissions process.\n\nBrown President Christina H. Paxson said the deal preserves Brown's academic independence. The terms include a clause saying the government cannot dictate curriculum or the content of academic speech at Brown.\n\n\"The University's foremost priority throughout discussions with the government was remaining true to our academic mission, our core values and who we are as a community at Brown,\" Paxson wrote.\n\nIt is the latest deal between an Ivy League school and the Trump administration, which has used its control of federal funding to push for reforms at colleges Trump decries as overrun by liberalism and antisemitism. The administration also has launched investigations into diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, saying they discriminate against white and Asian American students.\n\nThe Brown deal has similarities with one signed last week by Columbia University, which the government called a roadmap for other universities. Unlike that agreement, however, Brown's does not include an outside monitor.\n\nThe three-year agreement with Brown restores dozens of suspended grants and contracts. It also calls for the federal government to reimburse Brown for $50 million in unpaid federal grant costs.\n\nThe settlement puts an end to three federal investigations involving allegations of antisemitism and racial bias in Brown admissions, with no finding of wrongdoing. In a campus letter, Paxson anticipated questions about why the university would settle if it didn't violate the law. She noted Brown has faced financial pressure from federal agencies along with \"a growing push for government intrusion\" in academics.\n\nSigning the agreement resolves the government's concerns without sacrificing university values, she said.\n\n\"We stand solidly behind commitments we repeatedly have affirmed to protect all members of our community from harassment and discrimination, and we protect the ability of our faculty and students to study and learn academic subjects of their choosing, free from censorship,\" she wrote.\n\nBrown agreed to several measures aimed at addressing allegations of antisemitism on its campus in Providence, Rhode Island. The school said it will renew partnerships with Israeli academics and encourage Jewish day school students to apply to Brown. By the end of this year, Brown must hire an outside organization -- to be chosen jointly by Brown and the government -- to conduct a campus survey on the climate for Jewish students.\n\nEducation Secretary Linda McMahon said Brown's deal ensures students will be judged \"solely on their merits, not their race or sex.\"\n\n\"The Trump Administration is successfully reversing the decades-long woke-capture of our nation's higher education institutions,\" McMahon said in a statement.\n\nThe settlement requires Brown to disclose a wealth of data on students who apply to and are admitted to the university, with information about their race, grades and standardized test scores. The data will be subject to a \"comprehensive audit\" by the government.\n\nIt bars Brown from giving preference to applicants because of their race. A 2023 Supreme Court decision already forbids such consideration, but the deal appears to go further, stopping Brown from using any \"proxy for racial admission,\" including personal statements or \"diversity narratives.\"\n\nThe $50 million in payments to local workforce development organizations agreed to by Brown are to be paid over 10 years.\n\nThat's \"a step forward\" from paying a fine to the government, as Columbia agreed to do, said Ted Mitchell, president of the American Council on Education, an organization of major universities. Still, Mitchell said, it remains unclear whether Brown and other universities are clear of governmental pressure.\n\n\"Let's remember, these are deals. These are not policies,\" Mitchell said. \"I had hoped that the Trump administration, when it came in, was going to be interested in having serious policy discussions about the future of higher education. They've yet to do that.\"\n\nColumbia last week agreed to pay $200 million to the government as part of its settlement. In negotiations with Harvard, the Trump administration has been pressing for the Cambridge, Massachusetts, school to pay far more.\n\nIn another agreement, the University of Pennsylvania pledged to modify school records set by transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, a deal that included no fine.",

      "fullContent": "Former Vice President Kamala Harris announced she will not run for California governor, but did not rule out another bid for the presidency.\n\nWASHINGTON ‒ The number of Black women elected to Congress has held steady in recent years, but a record number of Black women have served this year in state legislatures, often the pipeline to higher offices, according to a new report.\n\nA new report titled \"Black Women in American Politics 2025\" provided to USA TODAY shortly before its July 31 release, tracked the number of Black women serving in statewide offices, state legislatures and Congress over the last decade. The report found that at one point in 2025 there were 402 Black women serving in state legislatures, up from 240 nearly a decade ago.\n\n\"It's steady progress,\" Chelsea Hill, an author of the report, said of the 2024 elections.\n\nSince 2014, there's been a 67% increase in the number of Black women in state legislatures, according to the report by Higher Heights, which works to expand Black women's political power, and the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Jersey.\n\nState legislatures have long served as a path to Congress. In the more than 10 years since the first report, there's been an acceleration of Black women \"moving along the pipeline,'' said Glynda Carr, president of Higher Heights.\n\nLast year also marked some firsts for Black women with Kamala Harris' historic bid for president. Harris, who became the first woman of African American and Asian American descent to run for president and the first woman to serve as vice president, announced July 30 that she would not run for governor in California. She did not say if she had ruled out a presidential bid in 2028.\n\nLisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware and Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, both Democrats, also made history when they were elected the first two Black women to serve in the U.S. Senate at the same time.\n\nThere were no Black women in the Senate when the report was first published in 2014, Carr said.\n\n\"It's a reminder of why we do the work and a reminder of the program and the impact of the work,'' she said.\n\n'When Black women run, they do win'\n\nThere have been more opportunities over the years for Black women to run at the state level, said Carr and Hill. They pointed to more programs to recruit and train women candidates.\n\n\"When Black women run, they do win,'' said Hill, director of data at the Center for American Women. \"They have high win rates. At the congressional level, Black women have higher win rates than their counterparts.''\n\nIn the 2024 general election, 63% of Black women congressional nominees won their contests, outpacing the win rates of all female candidates at 49% and male candidates at 53% across race/ethnicity, according to the report.\n\nMany women serving in Congress are former state lawmakers. The number of Black women in Congress has nearly doubled from 17 to 31, including non-voting delegates, since 2014, the report found.\n\nThe Kamala effect\n\nHill called Harris' run for the presidency a \"galvanizing force'' for all women, including Black women.\n\nCarr said Harris' presidential bid \"shows the strength of a leadership pipeline for Black women.\"\n\n\"Here's a woman who had run and won on every level of government,\" Carr said noting that Harris served in the Bay area and the state of California for more than a decade.\n\nCarr said Harris' calculated decision not to run for governor will continue to inspire women and Black women to run for office.\n\n\"More importantly (it has) created a blueprint around 'how do you serve on a local level and continue to serve and run for higher office,'\" Carr said.\n\nMeanwhile, the report found there have been other gains. Eight Black women serve as mayors of the 100 most populous cities, including Karen Bass in Los Angeles , Muriel Bowser in Washington and LaToya Cantrell in New Orleans.\n\nChallenges remain for Black female candidates\n\nDespite the gains, women candidates often face hurdles, including fundraising, experts said. Some Black women candidates have complained that party organizations have been slow to support their bids.\n\nWhile there are fewer of those barriers, Carr said there has been an increase in misinformation about candidates and Black women have been targets of political threats.\n\nMost Black women elected to Congress have been Democrats.\n\nGOP candidates must also deal with the tension of Republicans pushing back against diversity, equity and inclusion, which often includes women. There's only been one Black Republican woman, the late Mia Love of Utah, elected to Congress.\n\n\"I certainly hope that I won't be the last one. I really do,\" Love told USA TODAY in 2022.\n\nAnd while there were a record number of Black women in state legislatures there are five states with no Black women in their state legislatures, Hill said. They include Hawaii, Idaho, Montanna, North Dakota and South Dakota.\n\nNo Black women governors\n\nOne place where there has not been a win for Black women is governorships. In the last decade, several Black women have run for governor, such as Stacey Abrams in Georgia, but have not won.\n\nMore are trying, including Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who running for governor in Virginia this year. Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, has announced plans to run for governor of Georgia in 2026.\n\nThe landscape will be different from 2024 when there were 11 governor races, Hill said. In 2026, there will be 36 open seats.\n\n\"Hopefully, we can all retire that factoid of 'there's never been a Black woman governor,'\" Hill said.\n\nMeanwhile, Carr and Hill said there may be more opportunities for Black women to run next year. There were 73 statewide races in 2024. Next year, there will be 200.\n\nHill said she's hoping to see Black women recruited, supported and running for some of those positions.\n\nThere's also a push for more Black women to run in districts with diverse populations, not just majority-Black districts, Carr said.\n\n\"In 2026, the work is to ensure that we are not losing ground and (that) there's an infrastructure in place for Black women to run for reelection, for Black women to run for higher office and for more Black women to run,\" she said.",

      "fullContent": "Kamala Harris told Stephen Colbert during her interview on 'The Late Show' that the system is broken and she wants to reconnect with Americans.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Kamala Harris denied that she was sitting out next year's California governor's race because she's holding out for a different office.\n\n\"No, no,\" she told \"The Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert during a July 31 appearance. \"Honestly, it's more, perhaps, basic than that.\"\n\nHarris said she thought a lot about running for governor in her home state. The 2024 Democratic nominee who lost to President Donald Trump had also previously served as California attorney general and one of the state's two U.S. senators. The 60-year-old who made history as the nation's first female, Black and Asian-American vice president was born in Oakland and now lives near Los Angeles.\n\n\"Recently I made the decision that, for now, I don't want to go back into the system, I think it's broken,\" Harris said.\n\nHarris said she long believed that the country's systems would be strong enough to defend the nation's core principles but she does not currently believe that's the case.\n\n\"I want to travel the country, I want to listen to people, I want to talk with people, and I don't want it to be transactional, where I'm asking for their vote,\" Harris, who has run for president, told Colbert.\n\nEarlier in the week, Harris released a statement that she would not compete in the California gubernatorial race in 2026. Yet, she left the door open to a 2028 presidential bid by saying that \"for now\" she would stay out of public office.\n\nShe repeated the phase on Colbert as she addressed his question about the California governor's race, while indirectly addressing speculation that she could launch a third presidential campaign. Harris said Democrats have \"lots of leaders\" they can look to at present and argued that it would be a \"mistake\" to put the future of the party on \"the shoulders of any one person.\"\n\nHarris ran a short-lived campaign for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination before joining Biden's ticket and serving as his vice president. She became the Democratic nominee for president in 2024 after Biden dropped out less than four months before the general election.\n\nDuring her abbreviated White House campaign Harris faced questions from voters and party insiders - plus Trump attacks - about whether she was doing enough to distinguish herself from Biden, who is now 82. In the Colbert interview, Harris signaled that she would not be commenting on her former boss' health and fitness for office when he quit the race.\n\nHarris said she has an \"incredible amount of respect\" for Biden, and she encouraged her audience to remember the former 45th president of the United States as someone who believed in the rule of law and the importance of public service and integrity.\n\n\"And that's where I'll leave that,\" she said.\n\nAs for the 2024 campaign, Harris said did not want to \"pile on\" Biden after he dropped out. \"There was a lot of piling on at that time, and I wasn't going to participate in that.\"\n\nThe former vice president was on the program to promote her memoir, \"107 Days,\" the publication of which she announced in a video that morning. The book will be published by Simon & Schuster on Sept. 23.\n\nIt was Harris' eighth appearance on the program, which was CBS cancelled last month and will end next year, and her first interview about her forthcoming memoir.\n\nDuring the interview she teased a passage in the book about her last birthday. She said her husband, Doug Emhoff, \"kind of dropped the ball,\" last October when she turned 60 just before the election.\n\nHarris said she didn't watch the news for months after her loss to Trump. \"You know, I'm just not into self-mutilation,\" she joked.\n\nInstead, Harris said she turned to cooking shows. \"'The Kitchen' is one of my favorites,\" she said.\n\nDuring the Colbert interview, Harris also reflected on her drive to the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2025, for the certification of Trump's election win. Harris presided over the process in her capacity as president of the Senate and officially declared Trump, who received 312 votes at the Electoral College to her 226, the winner of the 2024 presidential contest.\n\nThat act invoked memories of the assault on the Capitol four years earlier, when lawmakers and former Vice President Mike Pence went through the same process to certify Joe Biden and Harris as the nation's next leaders, Harris said. During the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, Harris was in her final days still representing California in the U.S. Senate and was at the Capitol.\n\n\"It was a difficult day, because it brought up - it conjured a lot, in terms of what that exact day was, what that day has meant in the history of our country, the recent history of our country,\" she said.\n\nHarris said she had not spoken to Pence but complimented him for upholding the Constitution.\n\n(This story has been updated with more information and video.)",

But experts have a warning for federal and state health officials: Fall is coming -- so don't get too comfortable, Sophie and David report.\n\nOver the past few months, avian flu cases among humans, cattle and poultry have slowed -- easing fears that the U.S. could be hurdling toward another major pandemic and prompting the CDC to end its emergency response.\n\nWhen viruses collide: Eight public health experts and two state health officials from Washington and California -- two states hit especially hard by the outbreak -- told POLITICO that the decision makes sense if the federal government's case count is accurate. But they warned that things could shift quickly as the weather cools off. The seasonal migration of birds and the human flu season will increase the chance of a fall influenza-bird flu mash-up, which could make it more likely that bird flu will spread among humans, the experts warned.\n\n\"The most likely scenario is that someone will get infected with both H5N1 and a seasonal flu virus, and they will swap genes, and that reassortment could kick off the next pandemic,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a professor of epidemiology and director of the Pandemic Center at Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nAnd the emergency's end comes after the Trump administration canceled hundreds of millions of dollars it had awarded to Moderna to help the company develop an mRNA vaccine for flu strains with pandemic potential -- including avian flu -- leading some experts worried the U.S. isn't doing enough to prepare for the possibility of an avian flu outbreak.\n\n\"We are going to see another influenza pandemic, and it could be much worse than we saw with Covid, and we're not preparing for that at all,\" said Dr. Michael T. Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \"We have an opportunity with mRNA technology to make a vaccine much faster ... and yet, if you look right now, we've cut all funding within the U.S. government for that type of work.\"\n\nAn accurate case count? The World Health Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Organisation for Animal Health recently issued a joint assessment that the global public health risk of avian flu is low. The groups said their confidence in the assessment is medium, partly because there \"may be biases in surveillance, testing and reporting.\"\n\nNuzzo cautioned that hesitation among farmworkers -- many of whom are undocumented -- to be tested for the virus, as well as local politics, might make it more difficult to test people who've been potentially exposed to the virus in the fall.\n\n'A matter of time': Bird flu this summer has been comparatively quieter compared with this time last year, and Nuzzo doesn't think the virus is spreading under the radar at similar levels seen last summer. But she cautioned that while it's not clear when another flu pandemic will emerge, it's only a matter of time. Three major flu pandemics struck during the 1900s, part of a pattern of recurring outbreaks throughout history.\n\nFormer CDC principal deputy director Nirav Shah said increased global connectivity, the convergence of the boundaries between animals and humans, climate change and the rise of dense cities mean the number of pandemic flus in the past century should be viewed as a baseline, even though society has new treatments and other methods to intervene faster than in the past.\n\nWELCOME TO MONDAY PULSE.

Send your tips, scoops and feedback to [email protected] and [email protected], and follow along @kelhoops and @sophie_gardnerj.\n\nBLUE STATE REBUTTAL -- Blue states filed a brief Friday opposing the Trump administration's request to the Supreme Court for relief from a lower court's order, Erin reports.\n\nThat order had blocked the administration from cutting grants related to diversity, equity and inclusion from the National Institutes of Health.\n\n\"The only unlawful decisions here are the federal government's,\" the brief says. \"The only urgency is that manufactured by NIH in its haste to implement its unprecedented and unreasoned policies. The government has not shown any need for a stay.\"\n\nIn addition to being unnecessary, plaintiffs argued a stay would harm universities and institutions in their states and could hurt the public if, for example, clinical trials are canceled. Plaintiff states included Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe administration requested relief last week on the grounds that the federal government shouldn't be required to pay for research not aligned with President Donald Trump's executive orders and his administration's priorities.\n\nKey context: U.S. District Judge William Young ordered the administration in June to restore hundreds of scientific grants the NIH terminated this year.\n\nDuring a hearing on two lawsuits about grant terminations, the Massachusetts judge, a former President Ronald Reagan appointee, rebuked the administration for what he called \"appalling\" and \"palpably clear\" discrimination against racial minorities and LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nCOMMON GROUND WITH AMA -- Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, the American Medical Association's new president, is seeking common ground with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., even as the AMA has skirmished with Kennedy over his changes at HHS, Simon reports.\n\nMukkamala told POLITICO on Friday he supports Kennedy's push to swap out unhealthy food additives, like Coca-Cola's decision to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its soda recipe. He added that he wants to prevent food producers from \"dictating\" Americans' diets. Mukkamala, an otolaryngologist, has a background in lifestyle medicine, which lines up with Kennedy's interest in preventive care.\n\nBut Mukkamala, who has been gearing up for his role for several months, said he hasn't met or spoken with the secretary. He earlier sent two letters to Kennedy on his personal letterhead that he described as entreaties to find common ground upon his appointment as secretary.\n\nHis letters went unanswered, Mukkamala said at the Asian American Journalists Association conference in Seattle on Friday.\n\nKennedy has been critical of the AMA, arguing it doesn't have patients' best interests in mind, as the group has pushed back and argued that the secretary has devalued expertise in HHS ranks. The doctors' group criticized the purge of experts from a vaccine safety panel and warned gravely about a similar dismissal Kennedy might take against an HHS preventative care task force.\n\nMukkamala, in his AAJA session, was also skeptical of Susan Monarez, the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades after her confirmation Tuesday.\n\n\"To have someone that is a medical doctor is critically important,\" he said. \"And you put them in a position like that, you have to wonder, how good are they going to be at that, right?\"\n\nMonarez earned a doctorate in microbiology and immunology and was deputy director of ARPA-H, the agency former President Joe Biden created several years ago to invest in high-risk, high-reward research.\n\nNEW KENNEDY OP-ED -- On Friday afternoon, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. took to a publication called Trial Site News -- a website that often publishes anti-vaccine activists -- to criticize a recent study by Danish researchers that found no harms associated with exposure to low amounts of aluminum through early childhood vaccinations.\n\nBefore Kennedy became health secretary, he spread misinformation about vaccines and co-founded the Children's Health Defense, an anti-vaccine group.\n\nThe study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in July, used nationwide registry data of more than 1,000,000 children to look for links between aluminum exposure and 50 chronic disorders, including autism.\n\nKennedy argues that the study's design makes its results unreliable, including the decision to exclude children diagnosed with certain congenital or preexisting conditions from the study.\n\n\"The architects of this study meticulously designed it not to find harm,\" Kennedy writes. \"From the outset, Andersson et al. excluded the very children most likely to reveal injuries associated with high exposures to aluminum adjuvants in childhood vaccines.\"\n\nThe study's first author did not respond to a request for comment. The findings largely align with other studies that have found no evidence linking vaccines to autism or other neurological conditions.\n\nPOLITICO's Samuel Benson reports that West Virginia schools have banned certain artificial food dyes.\n\nCBS News' Kaia Hubbard reports on CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz announcing applications for the rural hospital fund will go out in early September.",

Voting rights advocates say they're undermining the promises of the Act and threatening the American system itself.\n\n\"Democracy is in crisis,'' said Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League, a civil rights organization. \"Sixty years after the Voting Rights Act transformed America's democracy, the promise is again under threat.\"\n\nVoting rights advocates, experts and lawmakers are marking the Aug. 6 anniversary with panels and programs. They have also pressed Congress to support federal voting rights legislation named after the late civil rights icon Georgia Rep. John Lewis.\n\nThe law helped all voters, not just Black voters and not just those in the South, said Janai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that American people will see how important those protections are for all of us,\" said Nelson, whose organization has challenged restrictive voting bills in the courts. \"I think that many people felt that this law was there because the South, and the South only, was a rogue actor.''\n\n'Needs to be recognized for what it's achieved'\n\nIn the decades since the Voting Rights Act was signed into law Aug. 6, 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson, civil rights activists said it has helped increase the number of Black voters and in some places led to the election of record numbers of Black leaders.\n\n\"It needs to be recognized for what it's achieved,\" said Courtland Cox, a veteran of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, noting that there are currently Black mayors in several major cities, including Washington, D.C., Los Angeles and New York.\n\nVoting rights advocates also noted the historic bid of Kamala Harris, who was the first woman to serve as vice president and in 2024 became the first woman of African American and Asian American descent to run president.\n\nThey point to New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic congressional leader, and the influential South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn.\n\nAt one point in 2025, a record number of Black women served in state legislatures, according to a recent report by Higher Heights and the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\n\"There's more to do,\" said Cox. \"The more to do is not about voting, it's about exercising power.\"\n\n'Voting rights gave you power'\n\nSix decades ago, civil rights activists braved violence to mobilize Black people, particularly in the South, to register and vote. Those efforts led to the Voting Rights Act, often called the crown jewel of the Civil Rights Movement, which helped protect against discriminatory laws, including some that required Black voters to pass literacy tests or pay poll taxes to vote.\n\nThe act was probably more important than anything that happened during the movement, Cox of SNCC said.\n\n\"At best, civil rights gave you access,\" he said. \"Voting rights gave you power.\"\n\nBlack voters in Georgia are credited with helping send two Democrats to the U.S. Senate and helping Joe Biden, the Democrat presidential candidate, win in 2020 in the conservative state.\n\n\"We have some real sway in the South,\" said Dann J. Broyld, associate professor in African American History at the University of Massachusetts, Lowell. \"There's no question that Black people can determine an election.\"\n\nFrom bipartisan support to backlash\n\nFor years, the act had mostly bipartisan congressional support, including when it was reauthorized in 2006. But more recent voting rights legislation, including the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, have stalled in Congress along party lines. The bill would, among other things, restore provisions in the Voting Rights Act requiring approval for election changes.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed with the ways in which Congress kind of keeps Black people on the hamster wheel to get this thing renewed,'' said Broyld. \"It's going to take some people who believe in democracy and believe in not abridging people's right to vote.\"\n\nCivil rights leaders are also concerned about other efforts to dilute the law and restrict access to the polls in some states.\n\nSeveral states proposed more restrictive laws soon after the U.S. Supreme Court Shelby v. Holder ruling in 2013 eliminated a provision of the Voting Rights Act that required jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to get federal approval before making election changes.\n\nAdvocates believe the backlash is a response, at least in part, to increasing Black political power and the 2008 election of Barack Obama, the nation's first Black president.\n\n'We fight back'\n\nSome advocates worry that not enough attention has been paid to threats against voting rights protections.\n\n\"It's hard for people to pay attention in the midst of this chaos,\" said Fatima Goss Graves, president and CEO of the National Women's Law Center Action Fund.\n\nGoss Graves and other activists point to what they call efforts by the Trump administration to dismantle some civil rights gains.\n\nMeanwhile, she said, people should push back against the Republican's SAVE Act. The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility would among other things require voters to show proof of citizenship in person for federal elections. Noncitizens are already blocked from voting in federal elections.\n\n\"It's going to be up to all of us to ensure that the SAVE Act continues to die in Congress and that we fight back,\" she said.\n\nRepublicans defend the legislation.\n\n\"In order to preserve this republic, we must uphold what it means to be able to vote in a U.S. election,\" Texas Rep. Chip Roy, the GOP sponsor of the bill, said in a statement.\n\nBut Sen. Cory Booker, a Democrat from New Jersey, slammed the GOP for trying to restrict access to representation, including efforts in Texas to redo congressional district maps that would give Republicans an advantage.\n\n\"That is a direct assault on the voices of African Americans and direct assault on all that John Lewis stood for,\" Booker said.\n\n'We can't just vote and sit down'\n\nBooker and other Senate Democrats recently ramped up efforts to focus on voting rights protections, including reintroducing the Lewis' voting rights bill.\n\nDemocrats in the House also continue to introduce federal voting rights bills despite little chance of passage in the GOP-controlled chamber.\n\n\"We are unfortunately facing the same struggle for voting rights,\" said Georgia Rep. Nikema Williams, who introduced a package of voting rights bills August 5. \"The tactics of voter suppression may look different, but the intent remains the same.''\n\nCox said it's important to take the fight to protect voting rights to the next level, including more political organizing.\n\n\"We need to be smarter, we need to do things differently,'' he said. \"We can't just vote and sit down.''",

Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nWith preparations for the 2030 census already underway, President Trump said Thursday he has instructed his administration to start work on a \"new\" census.\n\nIn a social media post, Trump also called for an unprecedented exclusion of millions of people living in the U.S. without legal status.\n\nThe 14th Amendment requires the \"whole number of persons in each state\" to be included in a key set of census numbers used to determine how presidents and members of Congress are elected.\n\nIt's unclear if Trump is referring to the regularly scheduled national head count in 2030 or an earlier tally.\n\nTrump said he's instructed the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, to \"immediately begin work\" on a census using \"the results and information gained from the Presidential Election of 2024.\" It's unclear why the election results would matter to the census.\n\nThe press offices for the White House, Commerce Department and Census Bureau did not immediately respond to NPR's requests for comment.\n\nWhile Article I of the Constitution has required a census every 10 years since 1790 for the once-a-decade redistribution of congressional seats, it's not clear whether the results of a census taken years before 2030 can be used for reapportioning each state's share of seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and votes in the Electoral College.\n\nTrump's latest push renews similar efforts from his first administration that sparked legal battles. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately stopped a question about a person's U.S. citizenship status from being added to 2020 census forms but declined to rule on whether people without legal status can be, for the first time in U.S. history, excluded by the president from apportionment counts.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden affirmed the longstanding practice of including the total number of persons residing in the states in those tallies with a 2021 executive order, which Trump revoked on the first day of his second term.\n\nUsing the census to ask about a person's immigration status has yet to be tested by the Census Bureau.\n\nBut research by the bureau shows that using the once-a-decade tally by the federal government to ask the question \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" is likely to produce faulty self-reported data and discourage many households with Latino or Asian American residents from getting tallied in official population totals, which are also used for dividing up trillions in federal funding for public services in communities across the country.",
